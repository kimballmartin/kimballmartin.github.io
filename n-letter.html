<h3 align="center">The Generalized n-Letter Problem</h3>
<p align="center">Kimball Martin and David Whitehouse </p>
<h3 align="left">Historical Remarks </h3>
<p align="left">In [MW], Martin and Whitehouse formulated the famous 3<em>-letter problem</em> which asks the following. Can you find a three-letter word (in the English language, without aid of a computer) such that any permutation of the letters also results in a word? This is the most interesting case of the similarly defined <em>n</em>-letter problem, at least at present, as the following results indicate.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Theorem 1</strong> ([MW]). Suppose the <em>n</em>-letter problem has a solution. Then <em>n</em> is rational. Moreover, assuming the Axiom of Choice, <em>n</em> is a positive integer.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Theorem 2</strong> ([MW2]). The 1-letter problem has a solution. </p>
<p><strong>Theorem 3</strong> ([MW]). The 2-letter problem has a solution. Examples of such solutions include &quot;NO&quot;, &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;ME&quot;.</p>
<p>It is evident that for <em>n</em> large, the <em>n</em>-letter problem has no solution. This can be easily seen from the fact that there are no words of length &gt; 45. (The Germans seem to have us there!) In fact, we can do considerably better than that. </p>
<p><strong>Theorem 4 </strong> ([MW]). Under the Continuum Hypothesis, the <em>n</em>-letter problem has no solution for <em>n</em> &gt; 3. </p>
<p>Martin and Whitehouse then devoted considerable time to the search for a solution of the 3-letter problem. They give an argument which seems to yield that there is no word with a repeated letter or with two vowels that can solve the 3-letter problem. In fact, after much disappointed searching, they were led to the following (now widely believed) </p>
<p><strong>Conjecture</strong> ([MW]). The 3-letter problem, sadly, has no solution. </p>
<p><strong>Remarks:</strong> <BR>
1) If you counted exclamations, &quot;HOO&quot; would be a solution. &quot;HOO&quot; and &quot;OOH&quot; are verbs, while &quot;OHO&quot; is merely an exclamation. Exclamations obviously don't count, even if they are in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), as I could exclaim &quot;XBQ&quot; and all its permutations had I the lingual dexterity.<BR>
2) If the ligature 'AE' ever turns into the two letters 'A' and 'E', then &quot;TEA&quot; will be a solution to the 3-letter problem with the help of the Scots (see below). </p>
<p>A proof at present, since the aid of a computer is not allowed, seems beyond the reach of normal human capabilities (and desire). Even with the aid of a computer, the justification of the adverb &quot;sadly&quot; in the conjecture seems elusive. In the present paper, we propose a more general problem for which interesting partial results seem more obtainable.</p>
<h3>The Problem </h3>
<p>The <em>generalized n-letter problem</em> is the following. Consider the set <em>W(n)</em> of English words of length <em>n</em> (as recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd or new ed., if you wish to be precise). Consider a word <em>w</em> of length <em>n</em>. There are <em>n!</em> ways to permute the letters of <em>w</em>. [If you don't know what a factorial is, go 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">here</a>.] 
Let <em>p(w)</em> be the number of such permutations which result in  English words. Let <em>a(w)</em> be the number of distinct anagrams of <em>w</em> (including <em>w</em> itself). These will be different if <em>w</em> has repeated letters.  Let <em>P(n)</em> be the maximum possible <em>p(w)</em> and <em>A(n)</em> be the maximum possible <em>a(w)</em>. Can you find words <em>w</em> and <em>x </em>(without the aid of a computer) such that <em>p(w)=P(n)</em> and <em>a(x)=A(n)</em>?</p>
<p>It is obvious that the classical <em>n</em>-letter problem is solvable if and only if <em>P(n)=n!</em>. In this case  a solution for the <em>n</em>-letter problem also solves the generalized <em>n</em>-letter problem.  Hence for <em>n=</em>1 or 2, we have <em>P(n)=A(n)=n!=n</em>. It may  be interesting to determine for which <em>n</em> the value of <em> A(n)</em> is different from that of <em>P(n)</em>. Note that if there exists <em>w</em> in <em>W(n)</em> with <em>p(w)&gt;n!/</em>2, then <em>P(n)=A(n)</em>. Below we exhibit a three-letter word with <em>p(w)</em>=4, hence <em>P(3)=A(3)</em>.</p>
<p>Before we state the known results, let us list a few other related questions of interest. </p>
<p>1. For which <em>n</em> is <em>P(n)</em> maximum? <em>A(n)</em>? I propose a betting pool. </p>
<p>2. Given <em>n</em>, what is the the best you can do for <em>p(w) </em>and <em>a(w)</em> among words <em>w</em> not containing an <em>s</em>?</p>
<p>3. As a sort of converse, what is the longest word <em>w</em> with no <em>sub-anagrams</em>, i.e., such that no subset (not necessarily proper) of the letters can be made to form a different word? What if you require that <em>w</em> has no repeated letters? </p>
<h3>Partial Results</h3>
<p>Here is a list of examples for various <em>n </em>which give the greatest known values for <em>p(w)</em> and <em>a(w)</em>.  Please contact me with any new results.  Attributes to other sources will be given in brackets. I will try to keep this list as current as possible. </p>
<p><em>n</em>=3</p>
<p><em>p</em>(TEA)=<em>a</em><em></em>(TEA)=4:  TEA, EAT, ATE, ETA [MW] (&quot;TAE&quot; is listed as a Scottish form for &quot;TOE&quot;; and the ligature 'AE' followed by 'T' is an obscure variant of "EAT" meaning food, is an obscure 
form of "AT," and also means "of or at the age of.")</p>
<p>If you believe in obscure variants, we also have <em>p</em>(LIE)=<em>a</em>(LIE)=5: EIL, LEI, ILE, LIE, ELI </p>
<p><em>n=</em>4</p>
<p><em>p</em>(MEET)=<em>p</em>(EPEE)=6: MEET, METE, TEEM x 2, EPEE x 3! </p>
<p><em>p</em>(STOP)=<em>a</em>(STOP)=6: STOP, SPOT, TOPS, POTS, POST, OPTS </p>
<p><em>n</em>=5</p>
<p><em>p</em>(SPEAR)=<em>a</em>(SPEAR)=8: SPEAR, SPARE, PARSE, PARES, PEARS, RAPES, REAPS,  REPAS </p>
<p><em>n</em>=6</p>
<p><em>p</em>(PEEWEE)=24: PEEWEE x 4! </p>
<p><em>n=???</em></p>
<p><em>p</em>(Mississippi)=4!*4!*2</p>
<p><em>Longest known word with no sub-anagrams</em>: SYZYGY </p>
<p><em>With no repeated letters</em>: CRWTH (it's also the longest word I know with no vowels)  </p>
