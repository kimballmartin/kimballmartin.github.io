<BR><BR>
here are some reading exercises for kevin houston's <i>how to think like a 
mathematician</i>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<ol>
<li>What are Houston's 5 points for a systematic reading method?

<li>Among techniques that Houston suggests, which have you been using
when reading Hammack?  Which haven't you been using?  

<li>Are there any pieces of advice that sound especially helpful for you?
</ol>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<ol>
<li>Why is it important to write solutions (or proofs) in complete sentences?

<li>Exercise 3.1
</ol>


<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<ol>
<li>Critique the sentence: "For x > 0, f(x) > 0, g(x) > 0." (You may assume
f and g are defined in advance.)
<br> Rewrite it more clearly.

<li>Critique the following solution to the problem: <i>Find the minimum
of x<sup>2</sup>-x.</i>
<br> Bad solution: <i>f'=2x-1=0.  x=1/2.</i>

<br>
Then write a good solution keeping in mind the advice in Chapters 3 and 4.
</ol>


<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<ol>
<li> Consider the following problem: <i>Determine if 
x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>4</sup> has infinitely many solutions
in positive integers.</i>  <br>
Spend about 5-10 minutes thinking about how to solve it with
Polya's 4-step method.  Write down your ideas/plan and what you tried.  
(I don't care if you
solve it, but if you did come to a conclusion, write that down as well.)

</ol>
