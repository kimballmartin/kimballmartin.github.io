<P>

<b>submit:</b> at the beginning of class on the due date.  if you can't turn
it in then, let me know as soon as possible.  

<P>
<B>guidelines:</B>  
first, you should actively try each problem on your own--don't just look up the
answer or ask someone how to do it.
i'm not giving you these problems because i want to know the answer for my own 
personal gain--i'm 
giving them to you so you understand them, and from there, the universe.
after the old college try, you are welcome to collaborate 
or ask me or a computer for help.
in the end, you are to write up (definitely not copy) your solutions yourself.
write clearly and legibly, in complete sentences.  
pretend you are trying to explain your solution to another 
student in the class, maybe one you have a crush on and are trying to impress.
also, staple.  write the course and section number and 
assignment number on top (e.g., homework 1), and maybe your name too.
if in doubt on the rules or expectations, ask me for clarification.
