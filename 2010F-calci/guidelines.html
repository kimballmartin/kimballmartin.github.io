<P><B>Contact note:</B>
Even though I may send periodic emails from my
university (@ou.edu) email address, 
I do not check it nearly as frequently as my department (@math.ou.edu) address.
Thus you are advised to use the 
address above when contacting me if you want a timely response.

<P><B>Prerequisites:</B> MATH 1523 at OU, or satisfactory score on the placement
test or ACT/SAT.  If you do not feel comfortable with the prerequisite material,
please see me as soon as possible.

<P><B>Class Participation:</B> Class participation (e.g., asking questions) is
highly encouraged.  It is not only helpful for you and other students, but it
also helps me understand what you are thinking and makes class more enjoyable.  
If you feel uncomfortable asking questions in class or discussion sections, 
you are especially encouraged to come to office hours. 

<P><B>Attendance:</B> Regular attendance of lecture and discussion sections
is strongly recommended and figures into the final grade (see below).
Attendance will be taken at the weekly discussion sections as well as at 
select lectures.  While you need not contact me about having to miss a 
single class
(unless it involves a scheduled exam or not being able to turn in a homework),
if you must miss several classes for whatever reason, please inform me.

<P><B>Office Hours:</b>You are encouraged to come to office hours (either
mine or a TA's) to ask questions and discuss the course.  This is also a good way for me to receive feedback on the course.  You are also welcome to make impromptu visits outside of office hours, though I may be busy or away.  If it is a premeditated affair, you can make an appointment with me.

<P><B>Help Center:</B> Another resource you are encouraged to use is the
<A HREF=http://www.math.ou.edu/undergrad/helpcenter.html>Mathematics 
Department Help Center</A> (payed for by your fees).  
It is open from 9:30-5:30 MWF and 9-5:30 TR and staffed with graduate students 
ready to help you.

<P>
<B>Homework:</B> 
Homework is, in my opinion, the most important part of the course.  Homework is where you really learn the material.  You should expect written homework every week, usually due each Monday at the <i>start</i> of class, and you should 
plan to spend roughly 6 hours each week on work out of class.  Each homework 
assignment will be posted on the course website, typically by the end of the
day the Monday before it is due.

<P>
Homeworks may also include bonus questions.  These will typically be more challenging questions (though not necessarily) you can submit with the written assignment for bonus points.<BR>

<P>
The homework policies are the following.  Turning in an assignment means that, 
to the best of your knowledge and ability, you honestly abided by the following.
Unless stated otherwise for a specific problem, you may not use calculators, 
computers (including the web), other texts or the solutions manuals to find the 
answers;  however you are allowed to use them to check your answers.  
Collaboration is allowed, and even encouraged, though you should earnestly try 
to solve each problem on your own before learning from someone else.  However, 
you are to write up (not copy) your solutions by yourself, in your own words.
<i>Late homework is not accepted</i>.

<p>
<B>Examinations:</B> There will be two in-class exams
and a final during the final examination period.  The in-class examinations
will be on <b>Monday Sep 27</b> and <b>Monday Nov 1</b>.
The final exam is <b>Thursday Dec 16</b> from <b>1:30-3:30pm</b>. 
Topics covered on the exam will be posted on <a href="exams.html">Exams 
Page</a> of the course website.
You may not use notes, texts, calculators, computers or other references during the exams.  Make-up exams are not given except in extenuating circumstances.

<P> <B>Grades:</B> 
It is always better to focus on learning the material and understanding the homework than to worry about grades.  If you do this, and put forth a sincere effort in the class, your grade should not be an issue.  This course is meant to be challenging and educational, but not stressful.  If you ever find yourself worried about your grade or how you are doing in the course, please come see me.  Please don&#146;t wait until the end of the term to do this.<BR>
<BR>
The grades will be computed as follows.  A raw score is computed for you, which is<BR>
<BR>
10% Attendance<BR>
25% Homework<BR>
10% Midterm 1<BR>
20% Midterm 2<BR>
35% Final<BR>
<BR>
Preliminary letter grades will be assigned to raw numeric scores.  Then I 
may adjust your final letter grade individually for such things as bonus points,
attendance/participation, consistently good homeworks, or improvement throughout
the term.  To get an idea of where you stand, shadow grades will be given 
after the first and second midterm.  

<P>
<B>Withdrawal Policy:</B> Through Sep 3, there is no record of a grade
for dropped courses. From Sep 7 through Oct 1, you may
withdraw and receive a W grade, regardless of your performance to
date.  From Oct 4 to Oct 29, you must come
see me if you wish to drop the course.  You may receive a W if 
you then have a passing grade in the course.  After Nov 1, 
withdrawing is a more serious matter, and you must consult with the Dean.

<P>
<B>Grade of Incomplete:</B> The grade of I is a special-purpose
grade given when a specific task needs to be completed to finish the
coursework. This is typically a term paper or other special
assignment, so rarely makes sense in a mathematics course. An I
cannot be given to avoid receiving a low grade.

<P>
<B>Academic Misconduct:</B> If cases of academic misconduct arise, they
will be dealt with according to (rather strict) University policies.  Remember
that you responsible for knowing and adhering to the University guidelines
for academic integrity:
<p>
<i><a href="http://www.ou.edu/provost/integrity/">http://www.ou.edu/provost/integrity/</a></i>
<p>
as well as the student code:
<p>
<i><a href="http://www.ou.edu/studentcode/">http://www.ou.edu/studentcode/</a>
</i>

<P>
<B>Religious Holidays:</B> It is the policy of the University to excuse 
the absences of students that result from religious observances and to provide
without penalty for the rescheduling of examinations and additional class 
work that may fall on religious holidays.  Please contact me (and/or your TA in
the case of missing a discussion section) in advance 
if you must miss a lecture or scheduled exam date for such reasons.

<P>
<B>Students with Disabilities:</B> If you have a disability that may
interfere with the demonstration of your abilities, please contact me as
soon as possible to arrange accomodations necessary to ensure your full
participation in the course.  You should also contact the Office of Disability
Services, Goddard Health Center, Suite 166 (325-3852 or TDD 325 4173).

<P>
<B>Final Remark:</B> Bear in mind that the course polices are put in place for
solely your benefit.  Please to not hesitate to ask me if you have any questions
about these policies.
