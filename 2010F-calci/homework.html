<P>
<B>Disclaimer:</B> The list of topics and due date for each assignment is 
tentative as will be updated as the semester progresses.
<P>
<B>Homework guidelines:</B>  Each assignment is to be stapled in the upper left.
At the top of the first page, write the assignment number (e.g., "Homework 3").
In the upper right hand corner of the first page, please write your name,
course and discussion section number (e.g. MATH 1823 - 031 if you're in
discussion section 31).  Occasionally homeworks will get misplaced (by the
students, instructor, TAs or otherwise), and this helps them find their way
home.

<P>
Solutions should appear in the order the
questions are listed on the homework, with any bonus questions at the end.  
If for
some reason you put them out of order, please make appropriate notes to redirect
the grader.  The assignment is to be written legibly and in complete sentences.
You will be graded not only on your final answer, but also on your explanation
and justification of it.  Your arguments should be clear and logically correct.
Justify each step.  Cite theorems and results when it is not obvious what you
are using.
You may use my solutions to examples in class as a guide.
The general principle is: you want to convince the grader you completely
understand how to solve it; present your solution as if you were teaching a
classmate who didn't know how to solve the problem. 

<P>
Please also be sure to read the homework policies on the 
<a href="guidelines.html">Course Guidelines</a> page.

<P>
Each homework totals to 100 pts.  
All problems are worth 10 points unless otherwise noted.

<P>
*STARRED problems are ones for which you are allowed to use a calculator or
computer for calculations and/or graphing.
