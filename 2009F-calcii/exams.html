<B>Note:</B> More information will be added as the exam dates near

<H3>First Midterm Exam:  Wed Sep 30 </H3>

Topics covered are roughly Ch 5, Ch 6 and Sec 7.1-7.4 in the text, plus
additional material we covered in lecture.  This corresponds to HW 1 - 5.

<H3>Second Midterm Exam:  Mon Nov 23 </H3>

The second exam will cover all methods of integration we have covered
(which range from Chapter 5 to Chapter 8), as well as the supplementary
material on inverse functions and L'Hopital's rule in Chapter 7.  Specifically,
you be comfortable with the material in Sections 5.5 (substitution),
6.1-6.3 (Areas and volumes), all of Chapter 7 and all of Chapter 8, excluding
8.6 and 8.7.

<P>
I will assign review problems on the HW 11 sheet, and we will go over some of
these Friday in class before the exam.  If you want additional review material,
look at the Review sections at the end of Chapters 7 and 8 in the text.  It
may also be helpful to review your old homework.

<H3>Final Exam:  Wed Dec 16, 8-10am</H3>

The final exam will be cumulative.  
I expect there to be some True/False, you will probably need to state the
Fundamental Theorem, and then do a bunch of indefinite integrals, as well as
a couple definite and improper integrals.  You may also be asked to approximate
an integral by the Midpoint, Trapezoidal or Simpsons rule, and compute simple
Riemann sums.  You should be familiar with the following applications:
position/velocity/acceleration, area, volume, arc length, surface area, and
average values of functions.

<P>
See HW 13 for a suggested review.  If you have any questions after the final
day of class, you may come to office hours during finals week (we'll discuss
times for office hours on Mon/Tue in class).
