<P>

<b>problems:</b> this is what is to be turned in.

<P>
<b>reading:</b> you can try turning this in, but i don't know how.
even if you can't figure out how to turn them in, you should still do
the readings, which will often fill in
things we don't have time to develop in class.  it's not a bad idea to try
reading in advance.

<P>
<b>submit:</b> at the beginning of class on the due date.  if you can't turn
it in then, let me know as soon as possible.  late homeworks may be penalized
or not accepted, depending on circumstances.

<P>
<B>guidelines:</B>  
first, you should actively try each problem on your own--don't just look up the
answer or ask someone how to do it.
i'm not giving you these problems because i want to know the answer for my own 
personal gain, and even if i did i don't need you to be my computer--i'm 
giving them to you so you understand them, and from there, the universe.
after the old college try, you are welcome to collaborate 
or ask me or a computer for help.
in the end, you are to write up (definitely not copy) your solutions yourself.
write clearly and legibly, in complete sentences.  
pretend you are trying to explain your solution to another 
student in the class, maybe one you have a crush on and are trying to impress.
also, staple.  write the course number, section number (3113-010) and 
assignment number on top (e.g., hw 1), and maybe your name too.
if in doubt on the rules or expectations, ask me for clarification.
