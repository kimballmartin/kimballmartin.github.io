<P>
<B>text:</B> the official course textbook is <I>Ordinary Differential Equations</I> by William A Adkins and Mark G Davidson, though we will not follow it
rigorously.  the book is available for download from bizzell.


<P>

<B>instructor:</B> <a href="../">me</a>

<P><B>class participation:</B> you don't need me to lecture you.  the in-class 
meetings will involve group work and discussions, and favor the socratic
method, so your participation is kindly requested.  but i'll tell you some
things too.  you will sometimes need to compute, so it will be helpful if you
bring along a calculator, abacus, rainman, or the like.


<P><B>homework:</b> homework good.  make you strong.  eat.

<p>
<B>examinations:</B> i will examine you every day.  why make a special occasion 
of it?  still, there will be

<p>
<B>quizzes:</B> we'll have many in-class quizzes, which will usually be
announced at least one class in advance.  quiz rules (time, open note, 
calculators, collaboration, etc) will vary by quiz and be explained per quiz.

<p>
<b>project:</b> there will also be a project, due at our scheduled final
exam period.  more details will be given later, but you should plan on spending
a fair amount of time each of the last several weeks of the semester on it.
i expect at least part of the project will be computational.

<P> <B>grades:</B> 
don't worry about grades, just worry about understanding.  or don't worry
about anything.  being an honors class, i expect most of you will get an a, 
provided you put in the effort.
if you care, i will compute a numerical score made up of

<p>
25% in-class participation (mostly graded on attendance, but if i think you're not participating enough, i'll let you know) <BR>
25% homework<BR>
25% quizzes<BR>
25% project<BR>

<p>
(if you don't care, i will just give you an a or an f, depending on the way
in which you don't care.)  if you are worried about your grade at some point
though, just ask me.  (just don't ask me "what do i need on the final to get
an X"?)

<p>
<b>final remark:</b> if you have a question about course policies or 
expectations, just ask.

<p>
oh, also there's some <a href="boilerplate.html">stuff my bosses make me say</a>
