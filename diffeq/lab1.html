<h3>in lab</h3>
<ol>
<li>start mathematica; follow along with my mini-intro with fibonnaci numbers.

<li>go through wolfram's  <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-programmers/">fast introduction</a>, up to the "function definitions"
section, including the "check your understanding" quizzes. 
(don't just read the mathematica code, but type it in and try it out).
(wolfram also has an <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction">elementary introduction</a> which is more basic with more
explanations if you
feel like you need it, but it contains a lot of stuff we don't care about.)

<li>graph the function y=e^x on [0,10] using mathematica's <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Exp.html"><code>Exp</code></a>
and
<code><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot.html">Plot</a></code>
functions.  using the <code>PlotStyle</code> option in <code>Plot</code>, 
redo the plot in red, and then redo the plot again used a dashed line.

<li>define the factorial function g(x) = x! for a nonnegative integer x 
recursively (without using the built-in factorial function), i.e., by g(0) = 1
and g(x) = x*g(x-1).  make a table of g(0), ..., g(10) with the
<code><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Table.html">Table</a></code>
function.
plot the table values with
<code><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ListLinePlot.html">ListLinePlot</a></code>

<li>put the previous two plots in different styles (different colors or solid vs
dashed) on the same picture with
<code><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Show.html">Show</a></code>.
see <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ayg/CS590C/www/mathematica/math05.html">here</a> for a way to do this in stages.
</ol>

whatever you do not finish in lab, please try to finish on your own before our
next lab.  on the other hand, if you finish early, you can get started on the
homework. 

<p>
<b>get mathematica for home:</b>
if you like, you can obtain a copy of mathematica for your own machine through
the <a href="https://itstore.ou.edu">ou it store</a>.

<h3>for homework</h3>

turn in print outs of your mathematica worksheets, with any extraneous work
cut out, on the due date listed on the <a href="homework.html">homework page</a>.  write your name and the lab number at the top.  though you may get help
from me or your classmates, all of your code should be typed in (not copied) by
yourself.  where appropriate, write problem numbers and explanations/comments 
by hand on your
printouts (esp. for #3).

<ol>
<li>consider the IVP y'(t) = 2t, y(0) = 0 and the approximate solution
f(t) formed as follows: let f(0)=0 and inductively define f(t)
to yield the line through f(n) of slope y'(n) for t in [n,n+1], for n = 0, 1, 2,
... 
(this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">euler's 
method</a> and is essentially the construction described on pp 17-18 of the 
text.  euler's method is also described in stewart's calculus book, and i will
briefly describe it in the next lab.) define the function f(t)
in mathematica at nonnegative integers t.
using <code>Table</code>, output the values of f(0), ..., f(10).
plot the graph of f(t) against the graph of y(t) = t^2 on [0, 10] (plot y as
a dashed line, and f as a solid line to distinguish).

<li>let f(t) now denote the approximate solution to the IVP in the previous
problem but instead of using line segments with change in x (Delta x) equals 1,
using line segments with change in x being some arbitrary step size denoted
<code>step</code>.  define a function <code>g[n_,step_]</code> which is 0 when
n=0 and the y-value of the n-th endpoint of the line segment for f(t) for
n=1, 2, 3, ...  using this function, plot on the same graph the different f(t)'s
for step sizes 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1 against the graph for y(t)=t^2 (again using
dashed lines for the latter, and you may want to use different colors for the
different f(t)'s.  all the graphs should go from 0 to 10 on the t-axis).  
for these graphs, it might be helpful to use the <code>Table</code> function to create a list of pairs of (x,y) coordinates
as in one of the <code><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ListLinePlot.html">ListLinePlot</a></code> examples.

<li>say you know a guy who knows a guy, and you invest $1,000 in this fund,
with a (nominal) annual return rate of 10% (meaning 10% annual return without
compounding).  let f(t) be the amount of money in your investiment assuming 
automatic reinvestments and no withdrawals after t years.  
graph f(t) for t in [0,10] in each of the following
situations: (i) compounding (once) annually, i.e., your returns are reinvested
once a year at the same return rate;
(ii) compounding monthly; (iii) compounding weekly; (iv) compounding daily.
(for ease of graphing, you may assume your returns are continuous at a uniform
rate, so the
graph for f(t) on [0,1] in case (i) is just the line from (0,1000) to (1,1010),
rather than a straight line from (0,1000) to (1,1000) with a jump at 1 to 1010.)
place all the graphs in a single plot.  are they approaching the graph of a
function you know?  if so, determine what function, and explain why, and 
plot them against this function.

<h3>other resources</h3>
if you want/need some additional learning tools, there is 
<a href="http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/259">a pretty comprehensive
list of mathematica learning resources</a> on mathematica stackexchange,
rannging from introductory to quite advanced.
perhaps the most useful for you at this point might be introductory videos 
(if you like videos; i do not) and wolfram's 
<a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/HowToTopics.html">how to's</a>.
