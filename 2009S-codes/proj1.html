<H3>Debriefing</H3>

Your cohort is broken up into three teams:

<P>
<B>Team Alpha</B><BR>
Scott Baker<BR>
Jennifer Holt (Team Captain)<BR>
Monica McDalton<BR>
Rebekah Smith<BR>

<P>
<B>Team Bravo</B><BR>
James Broda (Team Captain)<BR>
David Lamoureux<BR>
Billy Smith<BR>
Jody Shackford<BR>

<P>
<B>Team Omega</B><BR>
Riley Abel<BR>
Shawn Bass<BR>
Ben Harris<BR>
Kjell Sawyer<BR>
Joe Waterbury (Team Captain)

<H3>Task</H3>
<P>
Your task is to plan a strike on enemy territory.  For this, it is crucial
that you obtain aerial images, however a flight into this territory is 
extremely risky.  You can expect that a plane sent over will not return,
and any transmissions it sends before crashing will be thoroughly garbled
(transmitter jammed and/or damaged).

<P>
Design (or choose) and program the best code you can 
assuming you have a binary symmetric channel with error probability P=0.3.
For ease of programming, we will work with bitmap images.  
<a href="map.bmp">Here</a> is the image you are to use your code on,
and <a href="ecc.py">here</a> is code I have written that you may use.
Your code may or may not be linear, but the information rate should be 
no less than 1/6.  

<P>
First, use the ecc.corruptbmp() function from my code to see what your
image looks like without an error-correcting code.  Then encode the image,
apply the noise with P=0.3 using my ecc.addbscnoise() function (you
may skip the header if you wish--either before the encoding or while adding
noise--as I do in the corruptbmp function).  Then decode the image and
compare to the original, and the garbled image without any error-correction.

<H4>Analysis</H4>

Provide a detailed explanation of why you chose your code and 
do a theoretical analysis of the expectation probability of a bit error
in decoding (along this P=0.3 channel), and
compare that with what seems theoretically best possible in this situation
(information rate at least 1/6).
Write up your analysis including printouts of the images for all codes
you may have tried.  You are to turn in a typed printed report and email
your code to me.

<H4>Bonuses</H4>

The team to finish first will earn a bonus of 10 points. <BR>
The team to finish second will earn a bonus of 5 points. <P>

The team with the best code will earn a bonus of 10 points. <BR>
The team with the second best code will earn a bonus of 5 points.<BR>
