<P><B>Class Participation:</B> Class participation (e.g., asking questions) is
highly encouraged.  It is not only helpful for you and other students, but it
also helps me understand what you are thinking and makes class more enjoyable.  
If you feel uncomfortable asking questions in class, please feel free to ask
outside of class.

<P><B>Office Hours:</b>You are encouraged to come to office hours to ask questions and discuss the course.  This is also a good way for me to receive feedback on the course.  You are also welcome to make impromptu visits outside of office hours, though I may be busy or away.  If it is a premeditated affair, you can make an appointment with me.

<P>
<B>Homework:</B> 
Homework is a crucial component of the course.  Homework is where you really learn the material.  You should expect written homework every week, usually due each Monday at the <i>start</i> of class, and you should plan 
to spend roughly 6 hours each week on work out of class, with additional work
for the graduate version of the course (see below).  Each homework 
assignment will be posted on the course website, typically a week in advance.

<P>
Collaboration is allowed, and even encouraged, though you should earnestly try 
to solve each problem on your own before learning from someone else.  However, 
you are required to write up (not copy) your solutions by yourself, in your own words.
Late homework is not generally accepted, though under special 
circumstances extensions may be granted if requested before the deadline.

<p>
<B>Examinations/Projects:</B> There will be two exams as well as
two projects.
You may not use notes, texts, calculators, computers or other references during the exams.  Make-up exams are not given except in extenuating circumstances.
More information about the exams and projects will be announced in class
and posted on the website.

<p>
<B>Presentations:</B> 
Students enrolled in MATH 5383 will be expected to make several
presentations throughout the semester.  We will discuss this at the beginning
of the semester.  Students enrolled in MATH 4383 are welcome to
participate in these presentations, and will receive extra credit.

<p><B>Programming Component:</B>
In order to gain a deeper appreciation of the subject material, this course 
will have a modest computer programming component to it.  No previous 
programming experience is expected.  We will use Python 2 (note the newly 
released Python 3, while very similar, is not backward-compatible!).  
Programming will be incorporated in some of the homeworks, as well as the
projects.
The programming aspects will not be covered in lecture (or the text).  For
programming questions, please ask outside of class (after class,
office hours, email, etc.).

<P> <B>Grades:</B> 
The grades will be computed as follows.  A raw score is computed for you, which 
<B>for MATH 4383 is</B><BR>

25% Homework <BR>

Preliminary letter grades will be assigned to raw numeric scores.  Then I 
may adjust your final letter grade individually for such things as bonus points,
attendance/participation, and overall attitude and effort.

<P>
<B>Withdrawal Policy:</B> Until Feb. 2, there is no record of a grade
for dropped courses. From Feb. 3 through Feb. 27, you may
withdraw and receive a &ldquo;W&#8221; grade, regardless of your performance to
date.  From March 2 to April 3, you must come
see me if you wish to drop the course.  You may receive a &ldquo;W&#8221; if 
you then have a passing grade in the course.  From April 6 to May 8, 
withdrawing is a more serious matter, and you must consult with the Dean.

<P>
<B>Grade of Incomplete:</B> The grade of &ldquo;I&#8221; is a special-purpose
grade given when a specific task needs to be completed to finish the
coursework.  This is only an option in truly extenuating circumstances.
An &ldquo;I&#8221;
cannot be given to avoid receiving a low grade.

<P>
<B>Academic Misconduct:</B> If cases of academic misconduct arise, they
will be dealt with according to (rather strict) University policies.  Remember
that you responsible for knowing and adhering to the University guidelines
for academic integrity:

as well as the student code:

<P>
<B>Students with Disabilities:</B> If you have a disability that may
interfere with the demonstration of your abilities, please contact me as
soon as possible to arrange accomodations necessary to ensure your full
participation in the course.  You should also contact the Office of Disability
Services, Goddard Health Center, Suite 166 (325-3852 or TDD 325 4173).
