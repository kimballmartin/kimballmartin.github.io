After reviewing your write-ups,
I tested and compared your code on the following 
<H3>Test Image</H3>
<CENTER> <img src = "ax.bmp" WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=192></CENTER>

<H3>Corrupted (uncorrected) Image</H3>

<H3>Team Alpha's Repetition 5 Code</H3>
<CENTER> <img src = "axrep5.bmp" WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=192></CENTER>

<P>A simple repetition 5 code.  It is the best you can do in
a maximum entropy situtation (assume uniform random distribution
of 0's and 1's in data) in terms of number of bits correct.

<H3>Team Bravo's Enhanced Repetition 6 Code</H3>
<CENTER> <img src = "axbravo.bmp" WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=192></CENTER>

<P>Team Bravo used a repitition 6 code, but instead of guessing randomly
in the case of 3 errors/6 bits, they guess intelligently, using the idea
that for an image, neighboring pixels tend to have similar colors.  This
works considerably better than a straight repetition 5 or 6 code, as you
can see by comparing with the previous image.

<H3>Team Omega's Faulty Repetition 5 Code</H3>
<CENTER> <img src = "axdigrep.bmp" WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=192></CENTER>

<P>Team Omega tried to program a repetition 5 code in a clever way, and to their
credit it was quick, however it was not correct and they do not have
as many errors as they should.  (If programmed correctly, it 
should give something like Team Alpha's code.)

<H3>The Dark Horse (my code)</H3>
<CENTER> <img src = "ax-darkhorse.bmp" WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=192></CENTER>

<P>
My code was a [13,11,9,7,5,3,0,0] "weighted repetition" code:  For each 
byte, I repeat the highest order bit 13 times (or rather 12),
the next highest order bit 11 times, and so on, and just ignored the
two smallest order bits.  This capitalizes on the fact that we are working
with <i>images</i>, and the highest order bits are most important.
One can potentially do even better by combining this with ideas from image 
processing, as in Team Bravo's code.
