<B>Problems:</B>

<P>
Problem A: Let C be an [n,k,d] (binary) linear code.  Prove it contains
exactly 2^k codewords.

<P>
Problem B: Let U be a subspace of F_2^n.  Prove its dual is a subspace.

<P>
Problem C: Let V = F_2^n.  Find all vectors v such that v is orthogonal to
itself.  Do these
form a subspace?  Note that the existence of such vectors implies that
in general U and its dual ("orthogonal complement") are not disjoint, unlike 
the case of real or complex vectorspaces.
