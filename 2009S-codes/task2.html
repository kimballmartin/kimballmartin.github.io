<H3>RSA</H3>

<P>6. (corrected c) You discover that a phone number with crucial information is
encrypted with RSA.  The public key used by Bob is modulus n=61640471 and 
exponent e=3575.   The encrypted phone number you recover is c=44807459.  
Break the code by finding the private key d, and decode the phone number.  
Call the number and write down what you learned.

<P>7. Continuing the example from 6, suppose you want to pose as Bob and
send the message m=12345 to Alice.  You want to convince her this message
is indeed from Bob, so you will use his RSA Digital Signature (with his
modulus and keys from the last problem).  What should you send her?
Explain how Alice would use the digital signature to "check" that this message
is from Bob.

<H3>Elliptic Curves</H3>

<P>8. Let E_n = E(Z/nZ) denote the elliptic curve over a Z/nZgiven by 
y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 (coefficients to be taken in Z/nZ).  
(One can use elliptic curves over Z/nZ to factor n.)
For each 1 < n < 100, count the number of points on E_n.
Do you notice anything about how the number of points are on E_n 
is related to n (e.g., along the lines of Hasse's bound)?

<P>9. (Exercise 5.8 from Stinson) 
Let E be the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3+x+28 defined over Z/71Z.

(a) Determine the number of points on E.

(b) Show that E is not a cyclic group.

(c) What is the maximum order of an element in E?  Find an element having this
order.  (This will be an analogue of a primitive element for Z/nZ (whose
multiplicative group is cyclic).  Thus finding such an element is the
first step in elliptic curve cryptography.)

<P>10.  Explain how you can use the the elliptic curve and your element
of maximal order from 9 in the context of the ElGamal public-key
cryptosystem.  Also explain how you can use this system as a digital 
signature scheme.
