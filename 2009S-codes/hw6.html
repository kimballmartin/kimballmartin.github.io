From course text:

<P>
Chapter 10: 10.4, 10.5

<P>
Problem A: Let D=(P,B) be an affine plane of order n.  Show that
there are n lines in any parallel class. Conclude that there are
that there are n+1 classes of parallel lines.

<P>
Problem B: Let D be the affine plane of order 5 coming from F_5 x F_5.
Draw the points of the D as a 5 x 5 grid with rows and columns labeled
by F_5.  Draw the line given by y=2x+3.

<P>
Problem C: Let D be the affine plane of order 3 coming from F_3 x F_3.
Drawing the points as a grid as in the previous problem, draw all lines
of D.

<P>
Problem D: Using the last problem, draw a picture of the projective plane
of order 3.

<P>
Problem E: Write down a homogenous equation for y=x^2+3x+1.  By solving the 
homogenous equation, show there is only one point at infinity (give its
coordinates).  This shows both branches of the parabola y=x^2+3x+1 meet
at infinity, justifying our geometric intuition that the parabola becomes a
loop projectively.
