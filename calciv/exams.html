<H3>exam 1: fri sep 29 (in class)</H3>

this exam will cover all of chapter 14, excluding 14.5 (the chain rule).
while not necessarily a comprehensive list of things you may 
be expected to do on the exam, here are the main points you should be 
comfortable with (though there may not be time to ask about all of them on
the exam):

<ul>
<li> answer <b>true/false questions</b> about basic theory.

<li> find/sketch <b>domain, range, graphs</b> for simple functions of 2 
variables.  you may also be asked about <i>level curves</i>.

<li> determine <b>partial derivatives, gradients</b> 
of functions of 2 or
3 variables, and use this to write down equations for the <b>tangent plane</b>
of a graph z=f(x,y) at a point.  you may need to use a tangent plane to do
<i>linear approximation</i> to approximate the value of a 2-variable function 
at a point.

<li> compute <b>directional derivatives</b> of functions of 2 or 3 variables,
be able to determine the direction of fastest increase or decrease
of a function of 2 or 3 variables (e.g., convert the gradient to convert to a 
unit vector)

<li> find <b>local/absolute minima/maxima</b>, 
as well as <b>saddle points</b>, of functions of 2 variables.  (think:
critical points and second derivatives test.)  expect to have to deal with
regions with boundary points, where you may need to:

<li> use <b>lagrange multipliers</b> to maximize/minimize a function of 2 or 3 
variables subject to a constraint.  unless explicitly stated that you need
to use lagrange multipliers, you are also allowed to solve such problems by
the "substitution/reduction" method (e.g., as in example 5 in sec 14.7, 
though it may not be possible/easy to do so).
</ul>

there are review problems at the end of chapter 14 (pp 1021--1024)
for more practice problems.  some suggested problems from there are:

<ul>
<li>concept check: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7(a), 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19

<li>true-false quiz: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12

<li>exercises: 1, 3, 4, 13, 20, 25(a), 33, 43, 45, 48, 52, 56, 60, 63
</ul>

<H3>exam 2: wed nov 8 (in class)</H3>

the second exam will cover all of chapter 15, except for section 15.4.
while not necessarily a comprehensive list of things you may 
be expected to do on the exam, here are the main points you should be 
comfortable with (though there may not be time to ask about all of them on
the exam):

<ul>
<li> compute <b>double</b> and <b>triple integrals</b> 
in cartesian (rectangular) coordinates.  this includes setting up, and
possibly changing the order of, iterated integrals.

<li>compute <b>areas</b> of regions in the plane, and <b>surface areas</b> and 
<b>volumes</b> of regions in 3-space. 

<li> be able to go back and forth between cartesian coordinates
and <b>polar coordinates</b> or <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>spherical
coordinates</b>, including translating integrals between these
different coordinate systems.

<li> compute double integrals using general <b>change of variables</b>
</ul>

here are some suggested <b>review problems</b> from the chapter 15 review
in the book (pp. 1101-1104).  i recommend you attempt these before clas
on wed apr 5, and i can try to answer any questions you have about them
wed in class or during office hours.  (standard disclaimer: these exercises
do not necessarily cover everything you will be tested on.)

<ul>
<li>concept check: 1(abc), 2(a), 3, 6, 9, 10(ab)
<li>true-false: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
<li>exercises: 3, 5, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 19, 24, 25, 30, 31, 37, 38, 55
</ul>

<H3>final exam: th dec 14 (4:30-6:30pm)</H3>

the final exam will be cumulative, covering (most of) chapters 14, 15 and 16
of the book.  you should expect several true/false
questions, as well as a few (2-4?) problems on each of the 3 chapters
covered in this course.  a list of the main topics covered on the final
exam is:

<ul>
<li>all the topics listed in the bullet points above for exams 1 and 2

<li><b>vector fields</b>: be able to draw them (in R^2), determine if they are
<b>conservative</b> (in R^2 or R^3), compute <b>curl</b> and <b>div</b> (in
R^3), and know basic facts about div and curl

<li><b>line integrals</b>: be able to compute the various kinds
of line integrals (ds, dx, dy, dz and vector field line integrals),
both directly as well as using the <b>fundamental theorem</b> and
<b>green's theorem</b>

<li><b>surface area</b>: be able to compute surface area in the plane
with double integrals as in ch 15 as well as with green's theorem, and
areas of more general surfaces such as graphs of functions or parametric
surfaces as in sec 16.6

<li><b>surface integrals (scalar fields)</b>: be able to parameterize
surfaces and compute surface integrals of functions

<li><b>surface integrals (vector fields)</b>: expect 1 problem related
to surface integrals of vector fields, i.e. <b>flux</b>, such as computing
flux, directly or with the <b>divergence theorem</b>, or using <b>stokes'
theorem</b> to compute a line integral in R^3 as a surface integral.
there will not be more than one problem about flux, and it may be that
this problem can be solved without stokes' or the divergence theorem also,
but possibly such a solution will be more difficult.
on the other hand, there may be other problems not directly about
flux in R^3 for which you can use stokes' theorem or the divergence theorem.
</ul>

since there was no homework on the last 3 topics (flux, stokes,
divergence), here are a few
practice problems for you on this material:

<ul>
sec 16.7: 25, 27<br>
sec 16.8: 3, 7<br>
sec 16.9: 5, 7
</ul>

in addition, here are some suggested problems from the ch 16 review
(pp 1188-1190):

<ul>
<li>concept check: 2a, 3abde, 4ab, 5-10, 11bc, 12abc, 13cd, 14-16
<li>true-false: 1-13
<li>exercises: 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 17, 18, 25, 27, 29, 30, 33, 34
</ul>

(see the practice problems for the first two exams for chapters 14
and 15)
