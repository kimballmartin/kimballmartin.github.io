in class up to the theorem of the highest weight (any additional topics
from Chapter 10 we cover in the last week will not be needed for the exam).

<li>You have <b>24 hours</b> to complete the exam starting

envelope.  Please answer the questions on separate paper, and return the
exam to me by <b>Friday May 10 at noon</b> (at my office or in my mailbox).
<b>Write your name, start time and end time</b> at the top.

<li>No notes, text, calculators, etc. are allowed.  
If you are unclear about what I am looking for on one of the questions,
you can try asking me in person or by email (though depending on when
you ask, I may not be able to reply right away).
You are not allowed to talk to anyone else about the contents of this
exam until
Friday afternoon (May 10).
