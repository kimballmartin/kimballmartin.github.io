<P>

<b>submit:</b> in class on the due date.  if you can't turn
it in then, let me know as soon as possible.  

<P>
<B>guidelines:</B>  
first, you should actively try each problem on your own--don't just look up the
answer or ask someone how to do it.
while you're welcome to get help, in the end, you are to write up 
(definitely not copy) your solutions yourself.
write clearly and legibly, showing and explaining your work where appropriate.
also, staple.  write the course name or number (number theory, or math 4143) 
and assignment number on top (e.g., homework 1), and maybe your name too.
if in doubt on the rules or expectations, ask me for clarification.

<p>
all problems are exercises from the notes.  the "presenting" column lists
who (using first and last initials) should present what problems on the board.  

<p>
there are also reading assignments listed.  these of course are not to turn
in, and typically consist of things i don't have time to discuss thoroughly
in lecture, so please do them to help get a better understanding of the 
subject.
