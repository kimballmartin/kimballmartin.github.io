<H3>midterm exam: fri nov 3 (in class)</H3>

this exam will cover the first 3 chapters of the notes.  
while not necessarily a comprehensive list of topics covered on the exam, here
are the main things i am thinking about asking you to do on the exam.  in
terms of types of problems, i would expect the following:

<ul>

<li> answer true/false questions

<li> precisely state definitions/theorems with names (fundamental theorem of
arithmetic, Lagrange's theorem, Fermat's little theorem, Euler's theorem, etc)

<li> some computational exercises (by hand, no calculators allowed)

<li> write one or two simple non-computational proofs 
(possibly of a result that was already
proved in class, an exercise, or something new)
</ul>

in terms of content:

<ul>
<li> determine if something is a group/ring/field

<li> compute the gcd of two numbers (possibly in a imaginary quadratic ring)

<li> use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a solution (or prove
none exist) to a linear Diophantine equation: ax + by = c (possibly
over an imaginary quadratic ring)

<li> factor elements of irreducible quadratic rings into irreducibles
(which includes determining if an element in a quadratic ring is irreducible)

<li> check that an element of a quadratic ring has two distinct factorizations
or show why two factorizations are equivalent

<li> prove simple consequences of unique factorization (for Z or Z[i] or
Z[sqrt(-2)])

<li> be able to use/prove basic divisibility tests

<li> do calculations (e.g., exponentiation by repeated squaring, or
determination of squares, inverses, ...) mod n

<li> use modular arithmetic to show certain equations have no solutions,
or possibly no solutions of a certain form

<li> carry out an example of RSA and/or prove why RSA works

<li> be familiar with the terms in the <a href="bm.pdf">index</a>
(which occur up to p. 103)
</ul>

<H3>final exam: fri dec 15 (1:30-3:30pm)</H3>

the final exam will be cumulative.  specifically it will cover chapters
1-5 of the notes.  i intend to make the format as stated above for the
midterm (e.g., there may be true/false, even though i didn't end up putting 
any on the midterm).

<p>
in terms of content, here are the main things you should be comforable with
(this is not necessarily a comprehensive list of topics to study):

<ul>
<li> all topics listed above for the midterms

<li> fermat's two square theorem, including various aspects of the proof
(e.g., lagrange's lemma, the connection with unique factorization in Z[i], ...)

<li> understand the statement of the chinese remainder theorem and how to
use it to determine the euler phi function, and what is say about lifting 
congruences mod m and mod n to congruences mod mn

<li> know the statement of and how to use quadratic reciprocity (including the
first but not the second supplementary law) to compute legendre symbols
and apply to diophantine equations such as x^2 + dy^2 = n 
(you do not need to know the proof of quadratic reciprocity)

<li> know the statements of the three and four square theorems, but not
the proof or anything about quaternions

<li> know the structure theorem for units of real quadratic rings and the
relation to Pell's equation (e.g., knowing how to compose solutions to Pell's
equation)

<li> know how solutions of Pell's equation give good approximations to sqrt(d),
including the "1/2y" error bound

<li> be able to compute fundamental units or +units for Z[sqrt(d)], using
continued fractions or otherwise

<li> compute continued fractions of rational and quadratic numbers,

<li> be able to put together the above 4 bullet points to get rational
approxiations to sqrt(d) within a specified bound, as in the final exercises
of section 5.4 (section 5.5 will not be covered on the exam)
</ul>

i haven't made the exam yet, so i don't know how the content will be balanced
in the exam, but my inclination is to aim for the material on the midterm
(ch 1-3), ch 4, and ch 5 each to make up roughly 1/3 of the exam.
