<b>Guidelines:</b>
While you are welcome to work on assignments together and use
resources such as books and websites to help you figure out solutions or
check your work, all assignments turned in should be written by yourself, 
including any computer code.  Further, your solutions and code should not be
copied from any references or other people's work.  In summary, your solutions
should represent your understanding of the assignments.

<p>
<b>For computer problems:</b> Please provide
a printout of your input and output.  When appropriate, include
comments/explanation and a summary of your answer.

<li>Using R, determine the equation and plot the simple regression line
for the data x=(1,2,...,15) and y=(y_1,y_2,...,y_15) where y_i is p_i/log(p_i)
and p_i is the ith prime.  I.e., p_1 = 2, p_2, = 3, p_3=5, ...
</ol>
