webpage.

<B>Text:</B> The text for the course is Regression: Linear Models in Statistics
by Bingham and Fry.  This book is available electronically through the OU 
Library.  This course intends to cover Chapters 1-7 of the text, with additional
topics to be chosen from Chapters 8 and 9 or from other sources depending upon
student interest and time.

<P>
<B>Computer Software:</B> You will be required to use the statistics package R
for this course.  However, if you have a compelling reason to use a different
package, an exception may be made at the discretion of the instructor.

<P><B>Contact note:</B>
 Even though I may send periodic emails from my
university ou email address (as opposed to the math.ou.edu one above), I do not
check it nearly as frequently.  Thus you are advised to use the address above
when contacting me if you want a timely response.

<P>
<B>Class participation</b> and attendance are required.

<P>
<B>Out-of-class work:</B> 
There will be regular homework assignments as well as small projects in this
course.  Students enrolled in 5773 will also be required to make in-class
presentations regarding one of their projects.  Assignments 
will be announced in class and posted
on the course webpage, typically at least a week in advance of the due date.  
A rough guideline is that you should plan to spend
and average of 6 hours each week on work out of class.  Late assignments are
not permitted except in extenuating circumstances at the discretion of the
instructor.

<p>
<B>Exams:</B> 
There will be no exams.

<p>
<B>Final Exam:</B> 
The final exam period for this course is Thor's Day, December 13 from 
4:30-6:30pm.
While there will be no written final exam, this period will be used
for in-class presentations for students enrolled in 5773.  

<P> <B>Grades:</B> 
Your final letter grades will be determined from a final numeric grade
consisting of
<BR>
25% Class Participation<BR>
50% Homework<BR>
25% Projects (which includes the presentations for students in 5773)<BR>

<P>
<B>Withdrawal Policy:</B> 
Please consult the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/content/admissions/home/academic_calendar/fall_2012.html">academic calendar</a> for consequences of withdrawal
during different times of the semester.

<P>
<B>Grade of Incomplete:</B> The grade of &ldquo;I&#8221; is a special-purpose
grade given when a specific task needs to be completed to finish the
coursework. This is typically a term paper or other special
assignment, so rarely makes sense in a mathematics course. An &ldquo;I&#8221;
cannot be given to avoid receiving a low grade.

<P>
<B>Academic Misconduct:</B> If cases of academic misconduct arise, they
will be dealt with according to (rather strict) University policies.  Remember
that you responsible for knowing and adhering to the University guidelines
for academic integrity:

<P>
<B>Students with Disabilities:</B> If you have a disability that may
interfere with the demonstration of your abilities, please contact me as
soon as possible to arrange accomodations necessary to ensure your full
participation in the course.  You should also contact the Office of Disability
Services, Goddard Health Center, Suite 166 (325-3852 or TDD 325 4173).
