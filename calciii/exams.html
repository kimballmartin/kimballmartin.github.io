In particular you should be able to do the following:

<ul>
<li>State basic definitions and theorems

<li>Write down a parametric or polar expression for a curve

<li>Given a curve in parametric or polar form, draw a graph

<li>Go between parametric, polar and Cartesian forms for a curve

<li>Given a curve in parametric or polar form, find tangent lines,
the area enclosed by a curve, and the arclength of a curve

<li>Given a sequence or series, determine if it converges or diverges

<li>Find the limit of a convergent sequence or series

</ul>

<H3>Final Exam:  Thursday May 10, 1:30-3:30pm</H3>

The final exam will cover the material from the two midterms above, in addition
to the material covered in lecture since the second midterm, i.e.,
Chapters 11-14 excluding 13.6 and 14.4.  Here is a list 
of the main topics (but not all topics) covered since the second midterm.

<ul>
<li>Vector arithmetic (sums, scaling, dot product, cross product)

<li>Write down equations for a given line or plane, say determined by two
or three points (or equivalently by two lines)

<li>Determine the angle between two vectors, lines or planes; or 
the angle between a line and a plane

<li>Find the normal (or unit normal) vector to a plane through a given point,
or find a plane normal to a given vector which contains a given point

<li>Find the distance between two points, two lines, two planes, or some
combination thereof

<li>Parametric equations/vector equations for curves in 3 dimensions

<li>Find a (unit) tangent vector (or tangent line) to a curve at a given point

<li>Find the length of a curve

</ul>

Here are some suggested practice problems for Chapter 14, since there was
no homework assignment on this material.  

<ul>
<li> Section 14.1: 7, 9, 11, 19, 21

<li> Section 14.2: 9, 17, 19

<li> Section 14.3: 1, 5
</ul>
