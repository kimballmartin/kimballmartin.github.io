Data and Code

</CENTER>

Here is a selected collection of data and code related to some of my projects.
Feel free to contact me with questions, and/or requests for additional
data/code.  

<H3>
Galois orbits in weight 2 with prime level
</H3>

The following data tells you the size of every Galois orbit in S<sub>2</sub>(N)
(S<sub>2</sub>(&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N)) for N &lt 60000 prime.  



<ul>
<li><a href="galorbs-6e4.txt">text file</a> - each line is of the form
N: d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, ..., d<sub>r</sub> where N is a prime level, and the d<sub>i</sub>'s are sizes
of the Galois orbits
<li><a href="galorbs-6e4.sobj">sage object file</a> - this is a saved
dictionary in sage (version 8.7); the keys are the levels N, and the 
associated values are lists of the sizes of the Galois orbits
</ul>

This data was generated in Sage using the OU Supercomputing Center
(OSCER) for my paper:
<ul>
<li> <a href="../papers/maeda.pdf">
An on-average Maeda-type conjecture in the level aspect</a>
<BR><I>Proceedings of the AMS</I>, Vol. 149, No. 4 (2021), 1373-1386
</ul>
This paper explains how this data was generated.

<H3>
Dimensions of modular forms
</H3>

Here is code to compute dimensions of newspaces of (elliptic) modular forms of 
squarefree level, as well as the dimensions of individual Atkin-Lehner 
eigenspaces.

<ul>
<li><a href="refdim.sage">sage 8 code</a> (python 2 syntax)
<li><a href="refdim2.sage">sage 9 code</a> (python 3 syntax)
</ul>

The full newspace dimension is given in a formula by Greg Martin (JNT, 2005),
and the Atkin-Lehner eigenspace dimensions are given in my paper:

<ul>
<LI>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnt.2018.01.015">
Refined dimensions of cusp forms, and equidistribution and bias of signs</a>
<a href="../papers/refined-dim.pdf">preprint version</a>]
<BR><I>Journal of Number Theory</I>, Vol. 188 (2018), 1-17.
</ul>


<H3>
Quaternionic modular forms code
</H3>

Here is some code to compute examples of definite quaternionic modular 
eigenforms of trivial weight and character, which are the subject of a number 
of my papers from 2017-2020+, especially papers 20, 23 and 26 listed
on <a href="../math.html">my math page</a>.  
The nonconstant eigenforms here correspond the newforms of weight 2 
and squarefree levels N (with an odd number of prime factors).

<ul>
<li> <a href="qmfs.sage">sage code</a> - this is only for prime levels,
and the focus is on ordering the values of the so you see the symmetry of
the atkin-lehner operator with respect to the root number, rather than 
efficiency
<li> <a href="qmfs.magma">magma code</a> - this applies to maximal orders
in definition rational quaternion algebras, and so works for levels N which
are squarefree products of an odd number of primes
</ul>
