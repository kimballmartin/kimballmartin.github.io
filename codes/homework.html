<b>submit:</b> online through the <a href="http://canvas.ou.edu">canvas</a>
course page <b>before</b> the start of class on the due date.
for lab homework, you should submit 2 files: a .py file with your code
(e.g., in lab homework 1, the 5 functions you are asked to write),
and a pdf/screeenshot of your input/output when running/testing the code.  
submit a separate file for written exercises (which you may do by hand
or type).

<p>
<B>homework guidelines:</B>  
first, you should actively try each problem on your own--don't just look up the
answer or ask someone how to do it.
i'm not giving you these problems because i want to know the answer for my own 
personal gain--i'm 
giving them to you so you understand them, and from there, the universe.
after the old college try, you are welcome to collaborate 
or ask me or a robot for help.
in the end, you are to write up (definitely not copy) your solutions/code 
yourself.
write clearly and legibly, in complete sentences.  
pretend you are trying to explain your solution to another 
student in the class, maybe one you have a crush on and are trying to impress.

<p>
for <b>lab homeworks</b>, you should write comments explaining what your code
in your code (commenting every line is overkill) and appropriate
comments about your input/output (in particular, make it very clear where
the code is and where the input/output is in your files for each problem).

<p>
for <b>solving ciphers</b>, if the solution has a lot of 
details/trial-and-error you do not need to include all details of your 
solution process, but a summary of your approach with a few key details
is sufficient.

<p>
if in doubt on the rules or expectations, ask me for clarification.

<p>
<b>note:</b> in the problems listed below, "text" refers to 
problems from our course text <i>mathematics of encryption</i> and
"nt notes" refers to exercises from <a href="https://math.ou.edu/~kmartin/intro-nt/">my fall 2017 number theory notes</a>
(here sec 1.2: 1 means exer 1.2.1)
