<B>task 1:</b> 
write a function <code>shift(s,k)</code> that takes in a string s and an
integer k (the key) and shifts each alphabetic character in s by "adding
k mod 26."  do not modify any punctuation/spaces.  return this ciphertext in 
upper case.  test encryption and decryption (by shifting by -k) for
the plain text message <code>"Caesar is #1! (chronologically, for the ciphers we consider)"</code> with the keys k=3 and k=15.

<p>
here are some python commands that may be helpful, though not all are
necessary. recall <code>(a+b)%m</code> returns the remainder of (a+b) upon
division by m.  you can access each element of a 
of a string s the same way you would access elements of a list---either
<code>for x in s</code> or individually by, e.g., <code>s[5]</code>.
given a character (string of length 1) x, you can obtain the numerical ASCII
representation (e.g., 65 for A, 66 for B, etc) with the command 
<code>ord(x)</code>.  conversely, you can go from the ASCII representation y 
back to the character with <code>ord(y)</code>.  you can also test if a 
character x (or a whole string) is alphabetic by <code>x.isalpha()</code>.
lastly, you can cover an entire string
s to uppercase by <code>s.upper()</code>.

<p>
<b>task 2:</b> 
write a function <code>all_shifts(s)</code> that takes in a ciphertext s
and prints out all possible shifts mod 26 in lowercase, along with the 
amount of the shift (i.e., the key).  (you can convert a string s to lowercase
by <code>s.lower()</code>.)  use this to decode the message
XPPEL EXTOY TRSE.

<p>
<b>task 3:</b> write a function <code>affine(s,a,b)</code>
that takes in a string s and applies the affine shift x -> ax+b mod 26
to each alphabetic character x in s.  return the shifted text in upper case.

<p>
<b>task 4:</b> write a function <code>invert(a,n)</code>
that takes in an integer a and a positive integer n, and returns False if
a is not invertible mod n.  otherwise, this should return an integer b between
1 and n such that b is an inverse of a mod n.  do <b>not</b> use 
any results on which elements are invertible--just use the definition.
then use your function to determine which numbers between 1 and 25 are 
invertible mod 26.

<p>
<b>task 5:</b> write a function <code>affine_dkey(a,b)</code>
that takes in an affine shift encryption key (a,b) and 
returns the coefficients [c,d] of the inverse transformation x -> cx+d mod 26
if the key (a,b) is invertible.  if is not invertible, exit with an error 
message saying this.  
(the old way to exit with an error is to do something like print out an error 
message and <code>return -1</code>; a cleaner, more modern way in python is to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html">raise an exception</a>,
e.g. <code>raise ValueError("transformation is not invertible")</code>.
i recommend the latter, but do not require it.)   
using this and task 3, try applying affine cipher encryption and 
decryption on the message <code>"This is affine cipher.  But is it a fine cipher?"</code>
with the encryption keys (a,b) = (1,3), (a,b) = (7,2) and (a,b) = (13,25).

<p>
<b>task 6:</b> write a function <code>all_affine(s)</code>
that prints out all possible invertible affine transformations x -> ax+b 
mod 26 in lower case, along with the coefficients a and b.  use this to
decode the message RMIKZ MNHMO FMGET QKZYH.
