<a href="rsalab.py">my helper file</a> for this lab.  

<p>
it includes some
data for this lab as well as functions to convert strings to integers and back,
and determine the "block length" of strings you can use when working with
a modulus n.  


<P>
<B>task 1:</b> 
write a function <code>modexp(a,b,n)</code>, which a positive integer n and
non-negative integers a, b, computes fast modular exponentiation of a^b mod n
via repeated squaring.  (by a^b i mean exponentation, not bitwise as this
would mean in python.)
you may use the <code>binrep</code> function you
wrote for lab 5.  test your function on a few small cases, then test
<code>modexp(3,4567890,10000)</code> and compare the time taken with
the straightforward python code <code>3**4567890 % 10000</code>.
(recall the use of <code>timeit</code> from <a href="lab5.html">lab 5</a>
for timing code.)

<P>
<B>task 2:</b>
using your <code>modexp</code> function, verify
my rsa digital signature <code>sig2</code> (no hashing) of my message 
<code>m2</code> with my public key from the my helper file.
question: can you figure out why i might have chosen e in my public key to
bet 65537 = 2^16 + 1?  is there any security issue with different people
using this value for e?

<p>
<b>task 3:</b>
write a function <code>is_prime(p)</code> that, given a positive integer p,
returns <code>True</code> if p is prime and <code>False</code> otherwise.
you should check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of p.
(you do not need to check divisibility by all numbers up to the square root
of p, and i encourage you to implement simple speed-ups using this idea.)
you can compute the floating point square root of p in python by first calling
<code>from math import sqrt</code>, and then <code>sqrt(p)</code>.
test your function on all integers p between 1 and 50 by printing all
numbers in this range for which your function returns <code>True</code>.

<p>
<b>task 4:</b>
write a function <code>is_pseudoprime(p)</code> that runs the
following probabilistic primality test.  first, check that p
is not divisible by any number 1 < d < min(p,100).  (for efficiency, if you
wish, you can precompute a table of primes < 100, and test for divisibility by
these).  then, if p > 100, check that p satisfies the expectation from 
fermat's little theorem with a=2, i.e., that 2^(p-1) = 1 mod p.  
(this means that p is a <i>fermat pseudoprime</i> for the base 2)
return <code>True</code> if p passes both of these tests and <code>False</code>
otherwise.  determine how many numbers p up to 2^20 such that p passes your 
pseudoprime test but is not actually prime.  how does this compare with
the number of pseudoprimes (or if you prefer primes) up to 2^20?
also, compare the time taken to run <code>is_prime(p)</code>
for all p to 2^20 versus <code>is_pseudoprime(p)</code>.

<p>
<b>task 5:</b>
write a function <code>pseudoprime(k)</code>
that finds a random pseudoprime of at least k digits.
you can generate a random integer between a and b (inclusive) with the code
function <code>randint(a,b)</code> after calling <code>from random import randint</code>.  suggestion: generate a random number, test it for being a 
pseudoprime, and if it fails, increment by 1 (or maybe 2) and try again.
test your function several times for k=2.

<p>
<b>task 6:</b>
write a function <code>rsakeygen(p,q)</code> which returns a triple
(n,e,d) consisting of n=pq and a random pair (d,e) of integers such that 
de = 1 mod phi(n).  you should use your <code>modinv</code> function from
lab 5 to do this efficiently.  
test your function a few times on pairs of small primes (p,q).

<p>
<b>task 7:</b>
generate random pseudoprimes p, q which are each about 10-15 digits long.
(note: it's better not to pick p, q too close as there are factoring methods
that can exploit this, so it's better choose them to have not exactly the
same number of digits.)
use the previous function to make a public rsa key (n,e) and private rsa key d.
encrypt the message <code>m = "Psst! I know a secret about coronavirus."</code> with the public
key and then decrypt it with the private key.  note that you will
need to break your message into blocks, which you can either do "by hand"
or you can automate with auxiliary functions.
