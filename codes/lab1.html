in this course, we will be using the programming language python 3.  
the current version as of early jan 2020 is 3.8.1.  earlier versions
of python 3 are acceptable to use, though you may not have the
exact same functionality as everyone else.  however, we will not be
doing very advance things in python, so it should not be a real issue.
(if you are curious, you can read about
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html">the main differences between different versions of python 3</a>.)

<p>
note that python 3 is not entirely compatible with python 2 due to some 
different syntax.  for the labs and lab homeworks, and any programming
questions on exams, you must use python 3, not python 2 (and consequently
not <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">sage</a>) or other languages.

<p>
<b>warning:</b> i use python 2 all the time, so inevitably i will accidentally
use python 2 syntax from time to time.  please be understanding.


<p>
the first lab session is to get you up and running with python and 
started on some very basic programming.  

<h2>run, python, run!</h2>

there are many ways you can run python.  
python is an interpreted language, and when you run python 
in interactive mode it executes commands as you type, like a calculator.
this is sufficient for today's lab, but soon you will want to write programs
in an editor and save them as files, both so you can edit/debug/fix your 
programs and so that you can use functions you've written in previous sessions.

here are some directions for how to run python both just in interactive
mode and also with an editor.
if you are already familiar with python, just get started.
otherwise, pick one of the following:

<p>
<b>option 1: run python online.</b>

<p>
this is easy in terms of initial set up, but might be less
convenient than option 2 for serious use, depending on what you have and how 
you like to work.
there are various sites you can use to write and run python programs.
here are 3 possibilities, each with different features:

<ul>
<li>
<a href = "https://repl.it/languages/python3">repl.it</a> - relatively fast
and streamlined.  you can run python with an editor immediately without an 
account, and if you make an account you can save your files
online.  however the documentation is not super user-friendly (though
may be super-user friendly).  (challenge: find the documentation from the
above link!  shortcut: it's 
<a href="https://docs.repl.it/">https://docs.repl.it/</a>)


<li>
<a href="https://jupyter.org/try">jupyter</a> - a bit slow starting up but
has better documentation than repl.it.  
again, you can run the python without an account
in a "notebook", and you can also load/save your sessions 
to your machine without an account.  the notebook has "cells" that you can
edit and run separately, so it's kind of a blend in-between pure interactive 
mode and using an editor.
however, if you want to save your files online, it's not as automatic
as with repl.it and you need to you use something like 
<a href="https://github.com/">github</a>.
see <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MartyWeissman/Python-for-number-theory/blob/master/My%20First%20Python3%20Notebook.ipynb">here</a>
for a quick introduction to jupyter notebooks.

<li>
<a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/">pythonanywhere</a> -
provides an online console to run python in interactive mode.  if you prefer,
you can also run this from the <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">official
python page</a>.


</ul>

<p>
<b>option 2: run python on your computer.</b> 


<ul>
<li>if you are running mac/linux or have an hp computer, 
there's a good chance python 3 is already installed.
for mac/linux, try typing <tt>python3</tt> or <tt>python</tt> from the terminal.
(have a mac and don't know what terminal is?  <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/">see here</a>)
note <tt>python</tt> may by default run python2, not python3 so check what
version it is.

<li>otherwise, <a href = "https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">dowload python 3</a> (windows/mac/linux).  

<li>now you can run python in interactive mode, but eventually you will also
want an editor that can load and save your sessions.
one option is
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/education/download/#section=pycharm-edu">pycharm edu</a>.
see <a href="https://swaroop-c-h.gitbook.io/byte-of-python/first_steps">here</a> and <a href="https://swaroop-c-h.gitbook.io/byte-of-python/basics#how-to-write-python-programs">here</a> for how to get started with pycharm edu.
</ul>

<h2>python basics</h2>


<p>
<ol>
<li>go through this <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MartyWeissman/Python-for-number-theory/blob/master/P3wNT%20Notebook%201.ipynb">python tutorial part 1</a>
to learn some basics of python and do the exercises.  while you can
copy-paste some things to save some time, if you are new to python 
you should type in most of the
example code by hand yourself to help you learn it better.

<li>if you finish that, start going through the first half of this
<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MartyWeissman/Python-for-number-theory/blob/master/P3wNT%20Notebook%202.ipynb">python tutorial part 2</a> (the sections on python functions and control
statements) and go through the exercises.  
</ol>

<p>
you may not finish this all during the lab period, but 
you are expected to finish this on your own before the first homework.

<h2>lab homework 1 (due fri jan 24)</h2>  
here are some simple exercises with lists, loops and functions.

<ol>
<li> write a function called "count_vec(n)" that uses a while loop
to return (not print) a vector (list of numbers) [1, 2, 3, ..., n].  
(do not use the range function)
test this for n=1, 2, 10, 0, -3, 2.5.
(it's okay if your function results in an error for "unexpected"
inputs like 0, -3, 2.5.  but you should understand how it behaves
and why for unexpected inputs.  if you like, you may use control
statements to return an error message if the input is invalid,
but this is not necessary.)

<li> write a function called "squares(n)" that uses a for loop
and the range function to return the vector  [1, 4, 9, ..., n^2]. 
 test this for n=1, 2, 10, 0, -3, 2.5.

<li> write a function called "scale_vec(v,c)" that takes in a vector (list
of numbers) v and number c returns the vector c times v (i.e., each
element of the list should be multiplied by c).  test this for v=squares(5)
 and the values c=-1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 10.

<li> write a function called "shift_vec(v,c)" that takes in a vector (list
of numbers) v and number c returns the vector v+c (i.e., each
element of the list should be added to by c).  test this for v=squares(5)
 and the values c=-1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 10.

<li> write a function called "count_mat(n)" that returns an n by n matrix
whose coefficients are the integers from 1 to n^2, in order.  Here we
represent a matrix as a list of n row vectors.  for example count_mat(2)
should return the list [[1, 2], [3, 4]], which we view as the 2x2 matrix
with top row [1 2] and bottom row [3 4].  test this for n=0, 1, 2, 5.
</ol>

<P>
<B>further references:</b> 
for various assignments, including possibly the above one, you may need to 
learn a little more python
on your own.  check out the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide">official python beginner's guide</a> for more resources.
in particular, this
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3">wikibooks tutorial</a>
for non-programmers looks good.  i also like the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial">official python tutorial</a>, though it assumes some familiarity
with programming.  also, feel free to ask others (possibly me) for help.  
and i hear the internet knows everything.
