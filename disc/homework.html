<P>

<b>submit:</b> <del>at the beginning of class on the due date.  if you have to
miss that class, you can instead turn it in early (just ask).</del>
online through canvas by the end of the due date

<P>
<B>guidelines:</B>  
first, you should actively try each problem on your own--don't just look up the
answer or ask someone how to do it.
i'm not giving you these problems because i want to know the answer for my own 
personal gain--i'm 
giving them to you so you understand them, and from there, the universe.
after the old college try, you are welcome to collaborate 
or ask me or a robot for help.
in the end, you are to write up (definitely not copy) your solutions yourself.
write clearly and legibly, in complete sentences.  
pretend you are trying to explain your solution to another 
student in the class, maybe one you have a crush on and are trying to impress.
also, staple.  write the course (2513 or disc math) and the assignment
(homework 1 or problem set 1) on top, and maybe your name if you want credit.
if in doubt on the rules or expectations, ask me for clarification.
