<P>
<B>Note:</B> More information, with possible changes, 
will be added as the exam dates near.

<P>
<B>Exam Rules:</B> No calculators, notes, electronic devices (including
headphones) etc. are allowed.  Such items must be put away (e.g., in
a backpack, pocket, ...).  Some scratch paper will be provided for your
convenience, but no work done on scratch paper will be graded.  

<p>
If you need to use the restroom during the exam period, leave your
exam along with your phone (or show your pockets are empty) with an instructor
or TA at the desk at the front of the room while you are gone from the classroom.

<p>
After you have finished with the exam, turn it in (facing down) in the
folder for your discussion section, which will be at the front of the classroom.

<P>
<B>Exam Grading:</B> Your exams will be graded on correctness, not effort.
Exam problems will be of one of two types: short problems or long problems.

<p>
Short problems (possibly including true/false),
will be worth 1-2 points (some you may need to show work and
others not, as per instructions on exam).  
Partial credit will only be given sparingly, so you should
focus first on solving the ones you know how to do completely correctly,
and check your work.  For instance, you will have a much better score
if you solve half of the problems and write down nothing for others than
if you get all of the problems "partially correct" (e.g., 
"having the right idea" but "messing up the algebra" or just "missing a
sign").  
You should expect many short problems, which means
you should be sufficiently 
practiced on problems that you can solve simple problems quickly.

<p>
Long problems will require you do to several things, possibly being
split into multiple parts, and will be worth more points.  
Partial credit for these problems will be given according to a grading
rubric designed for each such problem.


<H3>exam 1: fri feb 16 (in 2:30 class)</H3>

topics: chapter 6 (special functions, excluding 6.5 and 6.7), and 
sections 7.1, 7.2

<p>here is a more detailed list of things you are expected to be able
to do for the exam (this is not necessarily comprehensive, but covers
the points most important to me; conversely, for time reasons not all of
the following will be covered):

<ul>
<li>determine when inverse functions exist, compute/graph them, know
their basic properties, and compute their derivatives

<li>graph exponential and logarithmic functions, know basic properties
(e.g., ln(ab) = ..., ln(e^x) = x, ...), and find their derivative/integrals
(e^x and ln x are the most important, but there may be a question involving
other bases)

<li>do logarithmic differentiation

<li>know the domains and ranges of the 6 inverse trig functions, compute
their derivatives

<li>know the integral formulas 12 and 13 on p. 480 (derivatives of arcsin and
arctan), as well as example 8 on same page

<li>know if a limit is in indeterminate form or not, and compute such
limits with the hospital's rule

<li>identify when integration by parts applies and carry it out
(possibly in combination with other techniques, like substitution)

<li>integrate various combinations of the 6 basic trig functions
(this requires knowing some trig identities as discussed in class;
you should also know integrals for sec x and tan x)

<li>possibilities for "cumulative" problems (calc i + calc ii): 
find minima/maxima of special 
functions (involving exp, log, inverse trig); graph special functions 
in part making use of the hospital's rule
</ul>

<H3>exam 2: fri mar 16 (in 2:30 class)</H3>

topics: chapter 7 (integration techniques, excluding 7.6, 7.7),
section 8.1 (arc length) and chapter 10 (parametric equations and polar 
coordinates, from 10.1 to 10.4)

<p>
while this exam is not explicitly intended to be cumulative (e.g.,
there will not be questions specifically about properties of inverse functions) 
many questions i may ask require competency with exam 1 topics.
so if you did not do well on exam 1, you should understand what you missed
as soon as possible.
(in particular, you should definitely be able to do all of the integral
from exam 1 and the associated mock exams)

<p>
what to expect: much of the 2nd exam will be similar in format to the 1st
exam, however there will probably be no true/false questions (due to the
nature of the material covered) and probably 1 or 2 "long problems".

<p>here is a more detailed list of things you are expected to be able
to do for the exam (this is not necessarily comprehensive, but covers
the points most important to me; conversely, for time reasons not all of
the following will be covered):

<ul>
<li>compute definite and indefinite integrals involving various
combinations of polynomials, rational functions, trigonometric
functions, radicals, exponentials and logarithms (all integration
techniques we covered up through 7.5).  note some integrals may
require a combination of techniques.

<li>determine if improper integrals converge or diverge, and
compute ones that converge (section 7.8)

<li>compute arc length of a graph of a function (section 8.1)

<li>sketch curves given in parametric or polar form; and find ther
tangent lines, enclosed areas and arc lengths (sections 10.1-10.4)

<li>translate between standard and polar coordinates in the plane
(section 10.3)

<li>translate between equations for curves in standard form 
(just in terms of x and y), parametric form, and polar form.  this
includes being able to write down a parametrization for a given curve.
(sections 10.1 and 10.3)
</ul>

of all of these topics, i would say arc length is the least important
(for the exam), as there will probably be at most one short problem,
or one part of a long problem about arc length (possibly in standard
form, or parametric, or polar).  so my suggestion is to work on mastering
the other material first. 

<p>
as i've said elsewhere, focus on being able to do problems on your own
(try them on your own, get what help you need, then try on your own again).
there are various exercises in the book.  here are some review exercises
i've selected, and we'll do some more in lecture/discussion before the
exam:

<ul>
<li>ch 7 review exercises: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 16, 21, 23, 33, 42, 49

<li>ch 8 review exercises: 1, 3

<li>ch 10 review exercises: 2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 21, 24, 31, 35, 39
</ul>

<H3>exam 3: fri apr 27 (in 2:30 class)</H3>

topics: chapter 11 (sequences and series), excluding the topics we
skipped in lecture (not covered: error bounds on estimates for series including
Taylor's remainder theorem, root test, binomial series)

<p>
what to expect: this will be similar in format to previous exams.
you should expect true/false like on exam 1, several short problems,
and 1 or 2 longer problems.  you will need to show your work for some
problems but not others.

<p>
while not necessarily a comprehensive list of topics, here are the main
things you should be able to do for the exam:

<ul>
<li>be comfortable with the notation for sequences and series,
and be able to write down expressions for general terms

<li>determine if a sequence converges or diverges, and often find its
limit (relevant: use of continuous functions, monotone sequence theorem,
and comparison with other sequences)

<li>know what it means for an infinite series to have a value (limit)
in terms of partial sums, and be able to determine the limit for special
types of series (geometric is the most important, with telescoping and
special values of power series also possible topics)

<li>be able to determine if a series converges or diverges using
various tests: divergence test*, integral test, p-series**, comparison*,
limit comparison, alternating series test*, ratio test**.  (more stars here =
more likely to appear on test.  if you are asked to determine convergence
on a problem where you need to show your work, you must state the name of
the test(s) you use.)

<li>know what radius and interval of convergence mean for power series,
and be able to determine them.  

<li>know power series (and radius of convergencs) for the following basic functions: 1/(1-x),
e^x, ln(1+x), sin x, cos x

<li>know how to write down the power (Taylor) series for f(x) about x=a by
manipulating the basic power series above as well as computing Taylor 
polynomials

<li>be able to use power series to compute integrals (e.g., the integral of
e^(x^2)) as well as approximate definite integrals and values of functions
(e.g., sin(1)).  (for approximation problems, i will say something like
use the first 4 nonzero terms of the power series for sin(x) to approximate
sin(1), which you can leave as 1 - 1/3! + 1/5! - 1/7!)

<li>be familiar with the harmonic and alternating harmonic series, and
understand the difference between conditional and absolute convergence
</ul>

here is a list of suggested practice problems from the end of chapter 11 
(pp 824-826):

<ul>
<li>concept check: 1-4, 5(a)-(g), 7ab, 8, 9, 10abc, 11abcdf

<li>true-false quiz: 1-22

<li>exercises: 1, 5, 6, 11-15, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 40, 41, 47, 48, 50, 51, 55,
57a (and use this to approximate sqrt(1.1))
</ul>


<H3>final exam: th may 10 (7:30-9:30pm, nielsen hall 170, bring id)</H3>

the final exam will cover the topics spanned by the 3 midterm exams,
with specific emphasis on integration techniques (chapter 7), polar coordinates
(chapter 10) and series (chapter 11).  
chapter 12 will not be covered on the exam.
that said, material from chapter 6 will be on the exam (you should certainly
know derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions, as well as arcsin
and arctan, and know how to simplify things like ln(e^2) or cos(arcsin x)),
but primarily it will arise as part other problems (e.g., in an 
integration by parts or a partial fractions problem) or in true/false questions.
you may also be asked to compute arc length (as in 8.1 or ch 10).

<p>consequently, my primary recommendation for preparing is to review your
midterm exams, and similar practices problems (e.g., those above or from the
mock exams).
