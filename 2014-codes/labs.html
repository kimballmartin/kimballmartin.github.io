<p class="indented">
This page contains some instructions and information for your weekly
meetings in the computer lab.  It also includes some "Lab Homework."
For the "Lab Homework," you should <b>turn in print outs</b> of your
code as well as your testing of the code on some sample inputs.
Include your name as well as the your course number at the top (either
4383 or 5383).
By default, the lab homeworks are due at the beginning of the class/lab
period on the due date.  You are welcome to work your code with, or get
help from, others (including me).  However you should type (not copy/paste
from another source) all your code yourself.  Your code should be well 
commented so that another student can understand what your code is doing.
