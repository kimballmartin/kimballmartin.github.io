<H3>Exam 1 (Fri Mar 14, in class, PHSC 809)</H3>

<p class="indented">
This exam will cover material discussed in lecture, lab
and homework through Wed Mar 12.  Expect some True/False
questions, short answer questions, calculations, Python
questions and simple proof problems.  In particular, you
should be able to do the following
</p>

<ul>
<li> Perform encryption/decryption given the encryption key
and plaintext/ciphertext for classical cryptosystems (shift,
affine, vigenere, substitution, columnar transposition).

<li> Break shift, affine, vigenere and substitution cryptosystems.

<li> Write code in Python to accomplish simple tasks

<li> Determine what simple Python code does

<li> Answer basic group theory questions (as in Homework 4)

<li> Solve number theory problems (as in Chapter 3, find gcd,
extended Euclidean algorithm,
inverses mod n, Fermat's little theorem, Euler's theorem)
</ul>

<b>Advice:</b> I recommend you prepare for the exam by
making sure you can do all homework and lab exercises.
In addition,  I recommend you do Exercises 3.14 and 3.15
from my Chapter 3 Number Theory notes.

<H3>Exam 2 (Fri Apr 25, in class, PHSC 809)</H3>

<p class="indented">
This exam will cover material discussed in lecture, lab
and homework through Wed Apr 23.  Expect some True/False
questions, short answer questions, calculations, Python
questions and simple proof problems.  In particular, you
should be able to do the following
</p>

<ul>
<li> Solve number theory problems (as in Chapter 3, find gcd,
extended Euclidean algorithm,
inverses mod n, Fermat's little theorem, Euler's theorem)

<li> Explain/carry out RSA (including key generation).
Explain how RSA is implemented both for key/message exchange
and for digital signatures.

<li> Carry out simple primality tests and factorization algorithms
(trial division, Fermat test, Miller-Rabin test, Pollard p-1).

<li> Find points on an elliptic curve mod p.  State Hasse's bound.

<li> Add points on an elliptic curve (over R or mod p).

<li> Factor with elliptic curves (if we get to this in time).

<li> Write code in Python to accomplish simple tasks
</ul>
