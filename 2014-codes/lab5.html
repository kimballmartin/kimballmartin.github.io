<B>Task 1:</b> 
Write Python functions 
<code>modexp1(a,n,m)</code>,
<code>modexp2(a,n,m)</code>,
and
<code>modexp(a,n,m)</code>
to compute a^n mod m using the 3 algorithms
we described in class.  Namely 
<code>modexp1</code>
just computes a^n first with n-1 multiplications and takes it mod m,
<code>modexp2</code>
computes a^j mod m for each j up to n, and
<code>modexp</code>
uses repeated squaring (and takes this mod m at each step).

<p>
In addition, here is a fourth way to compute a^n mod m: you can use
Python's native exponentiation function (don't in the above algorithms)
<code> a**n % m</code>, where the double asterisk denotes exponentiation
and the percent is mod.  

<p>
For the repeated squaring method, you will need to determine the binary
representation of n.  You can either do this by using division by 2 and mod 2,
or you can use <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators">bitwise
operations</a>.

<p>
For each of these 4 methods, compute 3^m mod m various values of m, and 
determine around what point (in terms of the number of digits of m) this method
becomes slow (say, takes more than a couple of seconds).

<P>
<B>Task 2:</b> 
Design an algorithm for and write a function <code>isprime(n)</code>,
which will return True if n is prime and False otherwise.  Test this on 
various n, in particular, n of the form 11, 101, 1001, 10001, ...  After
about how many digits does this algorithm become slow?

<p>
<b>Task 3:</b>
Recall the function <code>randint(a,b)</code>, which returns a random
integer between a and b (inclusive).  Using this, and the isprime function,
estimate the probability that a random k-digit number is prime, for 
k between 2 and 10.  (For small you can test all the possibilities.  
For larger k, sample a sizable number of random k-digit integers.)

<P>
<B>Task 4:</b> 
Design and algorithm for and write a function <code>factor(n)</code>
that will factor a positive integer n.  Return the factors of n as a list.
Repeat factors to represent prime powers.  For instance, if n = 60, you should
return the list [2, 2, 3, 5].  If your list does not come out in order by
nature of your algorithm, you can use the <code>sorted</code> function
to sort your list before you return it.
