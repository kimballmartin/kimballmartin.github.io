<P><B>Contact note:</B>
Even though I may send periodic emails from my
university ou email address (as opposed to the math.ou.edu one above), I do not
check it nearly as frequently.  Thus you are advised to use the address above
when contacting me if you want a timely response.

<P><B>Class Participation:</B> Class participation (e.g., asking questions) is
highly encouraged.  It is not only helpful for you and other students, but it
also helps me understand what you are thinking and makes class more enjoyable.  
If you feel uncomfortable asking questions in class, you are especially
encourage to come to office hours.  
Attendance is not taken, except for the first two classes.  

<P><B>Office Hours:</b>You are encouraged to come to office hours to ask questions and discuss the course.  This is also a good way for me to receive feedback on the course.  You are also welcome to make impromptu visits outside of office hours, though I may be busy or away.  If it is a premeditated affair, you can make an appointment with me.

<P>
<B>Homework:</B> 
Homework is, in my opinion, the most important part of the course.  Homework is where you really learn the material.  You should expect written homework every week, usually due each Wednesday at the <i>start</i> of class, and you should 
plan to spend roughly 6 hours each week on work out of class.  Each homework 
assignment will be posted on the course website, typically by the end of the
day the Wednesday before it is due.
Each homework assignment will contain up to 4 sections:<BR>
<BR>
1) Reading assignment.
<BR>
2) Conceptual questions:  These are to see if you understand what is going on, and I encourage you to think about them, and ask if you don&#146;t know the answer.  While they are not to be turned in, they (or similar questions) may appear 
on  the exams.<BR>
3) Written assignment:  This is what you are expected to turn in on paper and 
is graded.<BR>
4) Bonus questions:  These will typically be more challenging questions (though not necessarily) you can submit with the written assignment for bonus points (see &#147;Grades&#148; for what this means).  (One mostly correct solution to a bonus question = one bonus point)<BR>

<P>
The homework policies are the following.  Turning in an assignment means that, 
to the best of your knowledge and ability, you honestly abided by the following.
Unless stated otherwise for a specific problem, you may not use calculators, 
computers (including the web), other texts or the solutions manuals to find the 
answers;  however you are allowed to use them to check your answers.  
Collaboration is allowed, and even encouraged, though you should earnestly try 
to solve each problem on your own before learning from someone else.  However, 
you are to write up (not copy) your solutions by yourself, in your own words.
<i>Late homework is not accepted</i>.

<p>
<B>Examinations:</B> There will be two in-class exams
and a final during the final examination period.  The in-class examinations
will be on <b>Wed Feb 24</b> and <b>Wed Apr 14</b>.
The final exam is <b>Friday May 14</b> from <b>1:30-3:30pm</b>. 
Topics covered on the exam will be posted on 
the course website.
You may not use notes, texts, calculators, computers or other references during the exams.  Make-up exams are not given except in extenuating circumstances.

<P> <B>Grades:</B> 
It is always better to focus on learning the material and understanding the homework than to worry about grades.  If you do this, and put forth a sincere effort in the class, your grade will not be an issue.  This course is meant to be challenging and educational, but not stressful.  If you ever find yourself worried about your grade or how you are doing in the course, please come see me.  Please don&#146;t wait until the end of the term to do this.<BR>
<BR>
The grades will be computed as follows.  A raw score is computed for you, which is<BR>
<BR>
30% Homework<BR>
10% Midterm 1<BR>
20% Midterm 2<BR>
40% Final<BR>
<BR>
Preliminary letter grades will be assigned to raw numeric scores.  Then I 
may adjust your final letter grade individually for such things as bonus points,
attendance/participation, consistently good homeworks, or improvement throughout
the term.  To get an idea of where you stand, shadow grades will be given 
after the first and second midterm.  

<P>
<B>Withdrawal Policy:</B> Through Feb 1, there is no record of a grade
for dropped courses. From Feb 2 through Feb 26, you may
withdraw and receive a &ldquo;W&#8221; grade, regardless of your performance to
date.  From Mar 1 to Apr 2, you must come
see me if you wish to drop the course.  You may receive a &ldquo;W&#8221; if 
you then have a passing grade in the course.  From Apr 5 to May 7, 
withdrawing is a more serious matter, and you must consult with the Dean.

<P>
<B>Grade of Incomplete:</B> The grade of &ldquo;I&#8221; is a special-purpose
grade given when a specific task needs to be completed to finish the
coursework. This is typically a term paper or other special
assignment, so rarely makes sense in a mathematics course. An &ldquo;I&#8221;
cannot be given to avoid receiving a low grade.

<P>
<B>Academic Misconduct:</B> If cases of academic misconduct arise, they
will be dealt with according to (rather strict) University policies.  Remember
that you responsible for knowing and adhering to the University guidelines
for academic integrity:
<p>
<i><a href="http://www.ou.edu/provost/integrity/">http://www.ou.edu/provost/integrity/</a></i>
<p>
as well as the student code:

</i>

<P>
<B>Students with Disabilities:</B> If you have a disability that may
interfere with the demonstration of your abilities, please contact me as
soon as possible to arrange accomodations necessary to ensure your full
participation in the course.  You should also contact the Office of Disability
Services, Goddard Health Center, Suite 166 (325-3852 or TDD 325 4173).

<P>
<B>Final Remark:</B> Bear in mind that the course polices are put in place for
solely your benefit.  Please to not hesitate to ask me if you have any questions
about these policies.
