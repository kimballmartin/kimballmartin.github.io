<H3>First Midterm Exam:  Wed Feb 24 </H3>

Topics covered will be Sections 11.1-11.4 of the text, as well as Section 12.1
(up to and including p. 717).  You should be comfortable with the following:

<UL><LI>
Curves:
graphing parametric and polar curves, and going between parametric/polar
equations and Cartesian ones; finding tangent lines, determining concavity,
arc length or enclosed area for curves given in parametric/polar form; 
finding the surface area of a surface of revolution; 

<LI>
Sequences: determine the first several terms of a sequence, write down
a formula (possibly recursive) for the general term of a sequence, determine
whether a sequence converges or diverges, and in the case of convergent 
sequences find the limit.
</ul>

<P>
A fairly large selection of review problems is posted on the homework page
under "Homework 4." You are encouraged to try these problems and bring any
questions you may have to class on Monday or to office hours  before the exam.

<H3>Second Midterm Exam:  Wed Apr 14 </H3>

The second exam will cover Chapter 12 of the text, which is Sequences and
Series.  There will be an emphasis on power series and simple applications.
I suggest you review by reviewing your homework and doing Homework 10.
Bring any questions you have to class Monday or office hours.

<H3>Final Exam:  Fri May 14, 1:30-3:30pm</H3>

The final exam will be cumulative, with a focus on material since the first
exam.  You should expect that half or more of the exam will be on series, and
you would do well to review your second exam as well as your homeworks.
You should be competent with the following.

<UL>
<LI>Series: determine (conditional/absolute) convergence/divergence,
finding the limits of special series, computing integrals as series,
using the Alternating Series Remainder Theorem to find rational approximations
of series correct within a specified number of decimal places

<LI>Curves/Polar Coordinates in the plane: go back and forth between
the Cartesian (xy) equation for a curve, parametric equations and polar 
equations; determine the tangent line to a curve; determine the area 
enclosed by a curve.

<LI>Vectors/Curves in 3-space: write down vector and parametric equations
for lines and planes; determine lengths of vectors, unit vectors, normal
vectors, angle between vectors, area of a parallelogram; compute dot products,
cross products and understand what they represent; determine tangent lines 
to curves and arc lengths.
</UL>

I highly suggest you work through the

<P>
<A HREF="review.pdf">Final Review Problems</A>

<P>
and check your answers with the book (where available) or someone else, and
see me or the Help Center if you have any questions on these problems.
Remember my office hours will be Thursday 1:30-3:30 the day before the exam.
