<P>
<B>note:</B> more information
will be added as the exam dates near.

<H3>midterm exam: wed oct 30 (in class)</H3>

<b>content:</b> this exam will cover most of the first 3 chapters of the notes - more precisely,
<ul>
<li>
 sections 1.1-1.3, 1.5, 2.1-2.3, theorem 2.5.1 from sec 2.5, and sections 3.1-3.3.  
</ul>

while not necessarily a comprehensive list of topics covered on the exam, here
are the main things i am thinking about asking you to do on the exam.  in
terms of types of problems, i would expect the following:

<ul>

<li> answer true/false questions

<li> precisely state definitions/theorems with names (fundamental theorem of
arithmetic, Lagrange's theorem, Fermat's little theorem, Euler's theorem, etc)

<li> some computational exercises (by hand, no calculators allowed)

<li> write one or two simple non-computational proofs 
(possibly of a result that was already
proved in class, an exercise, or something new)
</ul>

in terms of content, be prepared to:

<ul>
<li> determine if something is a group/ring/field

<li> compute the gcd of two integers (detailing steps of the Euclidean algorithm)

<li> use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a solution (or prove
none exist) to a linear Diophantine equation: ax + by = c (possibly
over an imaginary quadratic ring)

<li> factor elements of irreducible quadratic rings into irreducibles
(which includes determining if an element in a quadratic ring is irreducible)

<li> check that an element of a quadratic ring has two distinct factorizations
or show why two factorizations are equivalent

<li> be able to use/prove basic divisibility tests

<li> do calculations mod n, such as determining of squares/non-squares or inverses of numbers

<li> use modular arithmetic to show certain equations have no solutions,
or possibly no solutions of a certain form

</ul>

<b>to prepare:</b>
here is a selection of

<ul>
<a href="midterm-prac.pdf">practice problems</a>
</ul>

to help you prepare for the exam.  i encourage you to review first (using note, homeworks, etc), and then try the practice problems on your own like a mock test, before using notes/asking for help on them.  bring whatever questions you have to class mon oct 28, which will be a review day.  relatedly, i will move my office hours that week from their usual time:

<ul>
office hours for week of oct 28: mon and wed 10-11am
</ul>

<H3>final exam: mon dec 9, 1:30-3:30pm, phsc 1105</H3>

the final exam will be cumulative, covering up to section 4.5 of the notes.  expect the types of problems i indicated above for the midterm.

<p>
in terms of content, here are the main things you should be comforable with
(this is not necessarily a comprehensive list of topics to study):

<ul>
<li> all topics listed above for the midterms

<li> know what are subgroups and cosets, and Lagrange's theorem

<li> know Fermat's little theorem, and more generally Euler's theorem, and how they can be used to find inverses mod n

<li> exponentiate mod n using repeated squaring

<li> understand how RSA works, and be able to explain/carry out certain aspects of it (e.g., decryption, or generating a public key from a private key)

<li> fermat's two square theorem, and aspects of the proof
(wilson's theorem, lagrange's lemma, and the use of unique factorization in Z[i])

<li> understand the statement of the chinese remainder theorem and how to
use it to determine the euler phi function, and what is say about lifting 
congruences mod m and mod n to congruences mod mn

<li> be able to use the law quadratic reciprocity (including the
first supplementary law) to determine whether a number is square mod a prime, or
apply to diophantine equations such as x^2 + dy^2 = n.  (i will provide you with statements of law of quadratic reciprocity, and the first supplementary law.)
</ul>

<b>to prepare:</b>
here is a selection of

<ul>
<a href="final-prac.pdf">practice problems</a>
</ul>

try to do these on your own before the final day of class, and bring any questions you have then, or to office hours.  if you would like to schedule a meeting outside of normal office hours, please let me know.
