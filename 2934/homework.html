<b>submit:</b> at the <i>beginning</i> of class on the due date.
<b>write your name and assignment number on
top</b> (e.g., marina celeste galilei hw 1) and <b>staple</b>.

<P>
<B>guidelines:</B>  
first, you should actively try each problem on your own--don't just look up the
answer or ask someone how to do it.
i'm not giving you these problems because i want to know the answer for my own 
personal gain--i'm 
giving them to you so you understand them, and from there, the universe.
<i>after</i> the old college try, you are welcome to collaborate 
or ask me or a computer for help.
in the end, you are to write up (definitely not copy) your solutions yourself.
write clearly and legibly, showing and explaining your work where appropriate.
if in doubt on the rules or expectations, ask me for clarification.
