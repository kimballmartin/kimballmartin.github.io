<B>rules:</B> no calculators, notes, electronic devices (including
headphones) etc. are allowed.  such items must be put away (e.g., in
a backpack, pocket, ...) during the exam period.  scratch paper will be 
provided for your convenience, but no work done on scratch paper will 
be graded.  

<H3>exam 1: fri sep 20 (2 hours)</H3>

topics: chapters 12-14 (excluding curvature, the chain rule and 
lagrange multipliers).  

in particular, here is a (not necessarily comprehensive) list of things
you should be able to do:

<ul>

<li>write down equations for <b>lines</b> and <b>planes</b> in 3 dimensions

<li>determine the <b>angle</b> between two vectors, lines or planes; or 
the angle between a line and a plane

<li>find a (possibly unit) <b>normal vector</b> to a plane through a given point,
or find a plane normal to a given vector which contains a given point

<li>understand <b>parametric/vector equations</b> for curves in 3 dimensions

<li>find a (possibly unit) <b>tangent vector</b> (or tangent line) to a curve at a given point

<li>find the <b>arc length</b> of a plane or space curve

<li> find/sketch <b>domain, range, graphs</b> for simple functions of 2 
variables.  also be able to find <i>level curves</i>
and <i>cross-sections (traces)</i>.

<li> determine <b>partial derivatives, gradients</b> 
of functions of 2 or
3 variables, and use this to write down equations for the <b>tangent plane</b>
of a graph z=f(x,y) at a point.  you may need to use a tangent plane to do
<i>linear approximation</i> to approximate the value of a 2-variable function 
at a point.

<li> compute <b>directional derivatives</b> of functions of 2 or 3 variables,
be able to determine the direction of fastest increase or decrease
of a function of 2 or 3 variables (e.g., convert the gradient to convert to a 
unit vector)

<li> find <b>local/absolute minima/maxima</b>, 
as well as <b>saddle points</b>, of functions of 2 variables.  (think:
critical points and second derivatives test.)  you may have to deal with
regions with boundary points.
</ul>

here is a list of <b>suggested practice problems</b>.  
try them before class thursday (sep 19), or at least determine which
ones you aren't sure how to do, and bring your questions to class
that day.  my recommendation is that you try these on your own,
check your
answers, get help with what you don't understand, and then make sure
you can do these problems on your own before the exam.  note: being able to
do problems on your own does not just mean without someone's help--it also
means without using other materials such as notes, the book, devices/internet, etc.

<ul>
<li>ch 12 review <br>
concept check: 1-6, 8,9, 11-18<br>
true-false: 1-10, 15-20<br>
exercises: 1, 6, 15, 17-19, 28-34, 37

<li>ch 13 review: <br>
concept check: 1-3, 5, 8a<br>
true-false: 1-4, 11, 14<br>
exercises: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 17, 19

<li>ch 14 review: <br>
concept check: 1-4, 5bc, 6, 7a, 8, 13-17<br>
true-false: 4, 7, 9, <br>
exercises: 1-5, 13, 19, 20, 25, 27, 33, 43-45, 47, 51, 52, 55, 63
</ul>

in terms of balance, expect that roughly half of the exam will be on 
chapters 12 and 13 and half will be on chapter 14.
in terms of types of questions, in addition to numerous specific problems
(similar to quiz problems and the above exercises), be prepared for
some conceptual questions.  these may take the form of true-false, 
explaining concepts/definitions or why something is or isn't true, 
or providing examples of certain conecepts/properties (with a sketch,
with words or with an equation).


<H3>final exam: th oct 17 (2pm-4pm)</H3>

topics: chapters 12-16, excluding curvature (part of 13.3), 14.5, 14.8,  15.4 and 15.9.  that said, most of the exam (perhaps 2/3 to 3/4) will focus on the
material not covered on the midterm exam, i.e., chapters 15 and 16.

<p>
in particular, in addition to the topics listed above for the midterm, you
should be comfortable with the following topics:

<ul>
<li> compute <b>double</b> and <b>triple integrals</b> 
in cartesian (rectangular) coordinates.  this includes setting up, and
possibly changing the order of, iterated integrals.

<li>compute <b>areas</b> of regions in the plane and 
<b>volumes</b> of regions in 3-space. 

<li> be able to go back and forth between cartesian coordinates
and <b>polar coordinates</b>, or <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>spherical
coordinates</b>, including translating integrals between these
different coordinate systems.

<li><b>vector fields</b>: be able to draw them (in R^2), determine if they are
<b>conservative</b> (in R^2 or R^3), compute <b>curl</b> and <b>div</b> (in
R^3), and know basic facts about div and curl

<li><b>line integrals</b>: be able to compute the various kinds
of line integrals (ds, dx, dy, dz and vector field line integrals),
both directly as well as using the <b>fundamental theorem</b> and
<b>green's theorem</b>

<li><b>surface area</b>: be able to compute surface area in the plane
with double integrals as in ch 15, with line integrals ds, or using
parametric surfaces as in sec 16.6.  

<li><b>surface integrals (scalar fields)</b>: be able to parameterize
surfaces and compute surface integrals of functions

<li><b>surface integrals (vector fields)</b>: be able to compute
to surface integrals of vector fields/<b>flux</b>, both directly and with the 
<b>divergence theorem</b>, and also use <b>stokes'
theorem</b> to compute a line integral in R^3 as a surface integral.
</ul>

<p>
you should expect the format and length of the final exam to be similar to that
of the midterm (several true-false/conceptual/short answer questions, and 
several problems which are more involved)


<p>
<b>practice problems:</b> you may review your midterm exam and the practice
problems for the midterm to review the material from chapters 12-14.  however,
you should primarily focus on the material from chapters 15 and 16.  
here are some suggested pratice problems for the latter:

<ul>
<li>ch 15 review <br>
concept check: 2, 3, 6, 9<br>
true-false: 1-3, 7, 9<br>
exercises: 10, 15, 19, 21, 28, 31, 37, 48, 53

<li>ch 16 review <br>
concept check: 1, 2a, 5, 7, 8, 11bc, 13bc, 14-16<br>
true-false: 1-8, 11-13<br>
exercises: 1a, 2, 5, 10, 11, 17, 25, 27, 33, 34, 37

<li>individual section exercises<br>
15.8: 23, 27<br>
16.6: 21, 25, 41
</ul>

<b>caution:</b> while there may be several ways to do a given problem on
the exam, one way may be much easier that others.  similarly, there are
multiple ways to do the above pratice problems and going through all of the
practice problems does not necessarily mean you have covered all of the
topics listed above.  so i recommend reviewing the above list of topics and
thinking about different ways you can approach the practice problems.
in addition, you may want to look in the book for other examples/practice 
problem to work out for topics you feel uncertain about.  and as always,
try to make sure by the end of your preparations that you can do these
problems on your own in reasonable amount of time.
