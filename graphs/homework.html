<B>Homework guidelines:</B>  Each assignment is to be stapled in the upper left and appropriately
titled with the assignment number and your name AND COURSE NUMBER 
appearing on the upper right hand corner of the first page.  For programming
exercises, you should print out your code as well as, where appropriate,
sample input and output for tests of your code.
Solutions should appear in the order the
questions are listed on the homework.  If for
some reason you put them out of order, please make appropriate notes to redirect
the grader.  The assignment is to be written legibly and in complete sentences.
For non-programming exercises, you  will be graded not only on your final 
answer, but also on your explanation
and justification of it.  Your arguments should be clear and logically correct.
Justify each step.  Cite theorems and results when it is not obvious what you
are using.
You may use my solutions to examples in class as a guide.
The general principle is: you want to convince the grader you completely
understand how to solve it; present your solution as if you were teaching a
classmate who didn't know how to solve the problem. (The same goes with
comments for your code.)  

<P>
Please also be sure to read the homework policies on the 
<a href="info.html">Course Information</a> page.

<P>
Unless stated otherwise, exercise numbers are from the course notes.
