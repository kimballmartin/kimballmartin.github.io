<P><B>Contact note:</B>
Even though I may send periodic emails from my
university ou email address (as opposed to the math.ou.edu one above), I do not
check it nearly as frequently.  Thus you are advised to use the address above
when contacting me if you want a timely response.

<P><B>Prerequisites:</B> 
I expect everyone to be familiar with reading and writing proofs, as
well as linear algebra (including eigenvalues and eigenvectors).  
E.g., our Discrete Math (MATH 2513) and 
Linear Algebra I (MATH 3333) will be sufficient for this.  If you have not
had these courses, or do not feel comfortable with this material, please
consult with me as soon as possible.

<P><B>Class Participation:</B> Class participation (e.g., asking questions) is
highly encouraged.  It is not only helpful for you and other students, but it
also helps me understand what you are thinking and makes class more enjoyable.  
If you feel uncomfortable asking questions in class, you are especially
encourage to come to office hours.  
Attendance is not taken.  However, not all material covered in lecture 
is necessarily in the text.

<P><B>Office Hours:</b> You are encouraged to come to office hours to ask questions and discuss the course.  This is also a good way for me to receive feedback on the course.  You are also welcome to make impromptu visits outside of office hours, though I may be busy or away.  If it is a premeditated affair, you can make an appointment with me.

<P>
<B>Homework:</B> 
Homework is, in my opinion, the most important part of the course.  Homework is where you really learn the material.  You should expect homework each week, 
usually due each Friday at the <i>start</i> of class, and you should 
plan to spend roughly 6 hours each week on work out of class.  Each homework 
assignment will be posted on the course website, typically by the end of the
day the Friday before it is due.  Since you may run into difficulities
or need assistance with the
homework (particularly with the programming problems), it is recommended
you start on the homework well in advance.

<P>
The homework policies are the following.  Turning in an assignment means that, 
to the best of your knowledge and ability, you honestly abided by the following.
Except where stated otherwise for a specific problem, you may not use the 
internet or other references to find solutions to exercises;
however you are allowed to use other references to check your answers.  
Collaboration is allowed, and even encouraged, though you should earnestly try 
to solve each problem on your own before learning from someone else.  However, 
you are to write up (not copy) your solutions by yourself, in your own words.
<i>Late homework is not accepted</i>.

<p>
<B>Examinations:</B> There will be one in-class exam, tentatively scheduled 
on <b>Friday March 14</b>.
More information will be posted on the course website as the exam dates
approacheth.
You may not use notes, texts, calculators, computers or other references during the exams.  Make-up exams are not given except in extenuating circumstances.

<p>
<b>Projects:</b>
There will be one project due at the end of the semester.
More information on the project will be posted on the course website.
Students enrolled in 5673 are also required to do a presentation
during the final exam period (Th May 8, 8am-10am) or the final week of
the semester, which students in 4673 and 5673 are required to attend. 

<P> <B>Grades:</B> 
It is always better to focus on learning the material and understanding the homework than to worry about grades.  If you do this, and put forth a sincere effort in the class, your grade should not be an issue.  This course is meant to be challenging and educational, but not stressful.  If you ever find yourself worried about your grade or how you are doing in the course, please come see me.  Please don&#146;t wait until the end of the term to do this.<BR>
<BR>
The grades will be computed as follows.  A raw score is computed for you, which is<BR>
<BR>
40% Homework<BR>
20% Exam<BR>
40% Project<BR>
<BR>
Preliminary letter grades will be assigned to raw numeric scores.  
The scores for letter grades will be determined at the end of the semester
depending upon the distribution of the numerical grades.  For instance,
an A might be 90-100 or 86-100.  However, the lower cut off for an A will never
be above 90% (similarly, and 80% will be at least a B, and 70% will be at least a C).  (I.e., I will likely "curve up" a little bit, but never "curve down.")

Then I may adjust your final letter grade individually for such things as 
attendance/participation, consistently good homeworks, or improvement throughout
the term.  

Letter grades will be assigned separately for 4673 and 5673 (i.e., the "curves"
may be different).

<P>
<B>Withdrawal Policy:</B> 
Please see the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/content/admissions/academic_calendar/spring_2014.html">academic calendar</a> for the university schedule and 
policies for dropping a class.

<P>
<B>Academic Misconduct:</B> If cases of academic misconduct arise, they
will be dealt with according to (rather strict) University policies.  Remember
that you responsible for knowing and adhering to the University guidelines
for academic integrity:

as well as the student code:

<P>
<B>Students with Disabilities:</B> If you have a disability that may
interfere with the demonstration of your abilities, please contact me as
soon as possible to arrange accomodations necessary to ensure your full
participation in the course.  You should also contact the Office of Disability
Services, Goddard Health Center, Suite 166 (325-3852 or TDD 325 4173).
