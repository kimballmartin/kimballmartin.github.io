<H3>Matrices in Sage</H3>

Here we'll be working with matrices in Sage.  Some points to keep in mind are:

<ul>
<li>You can multiply matrices
in Sage like numbers, e.g., <code>A*B</code> or <code>T*v</code>.
You can also exponentiate via <code>A**10</code>

<li>You can generate column vectors with the <code>column_matrix</code>
command, e.g., <code>column_matrix([1,2,3])</code>

<li>You can access Sage matrix rows and elements just like when we worked with
matrices in Python, e.g., <code>A[i]</code> for the i-th row or 
<code>A[i][j]</code> for the (i,j) entry.

<li>However, you cannot easily modify individual Sage matrix entries.
Consequently, if you want to modify a matrix, it is often easiest to make a
new one.  For instance, to make a transition matrix T from A, it's probably 
easiest to build T as a list of lists, as we made our matrices in Python, then 
convert it to a Sage matrix with the <code>matrix</code> command.
This is what I did for my <code>tm</code> function.

<li>If you want to format some of your results differently,
you can use my <code>matprint</code> to print matrices
with less precision.  You can also transform a column vector <code>v</code>
to a row vector with <code>v.transpose()</code>.
</ul>

<H3>Tasks</H3>


<p>
<B>Task 1:</b> For each of the following graphs G, compute the
transition matrix T and use this to study the behavior of a
random walk starting at vertex 0.  Try to determine the limiting
behavior of the random walk.  Discuss with your neighbors the
meaning of these results.

<ol>
<li>The path graph of length 3

<li>The path graph of length 4

<li>The cycle graph of order 3

<li>The cycle graph of order 4

<li>The star graph of order 4

<li>The complete graph of order 4

</ol>

<p>
<b>Task 2:</b> Let C5 be the cycle graph of order 5, and K5
be the complete graph of order 5.  For each of these graphs,
about how many steps does it take for a random walk starting at vertex 0
to approach of the limiting value (say, for each coordinate to
get within 0.01 of the limiting value)?  Which converges faster?  Why
do you think that is?  Discuss with your neighbors.

<p>
<b>Task 3:</b> Repeat task 1 for the Florentine families and karate club
graphs.  What does this tell you about which nodes are most important?
Discuss with your neighbors.
