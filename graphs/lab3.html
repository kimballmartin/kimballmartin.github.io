For the following problems, design an algorithm (write out either steps or
pseudocode by hand), analyze the maximum number of steps it take to run
in terms of <i>n</i> (the number of nodes of the graph) as in Section 1.3.3 of 
the notes, code up the algorithm
and test it out to make sure it works properly.  Unless stated otherwise,
assume we are working with graphs represented by adjacency matrices.

<P>
<B>Problem 1:</b> 
Make a program <code>is_adjacent(A,i,j)</code> that returns True if there is
an edge from vertex i to vertex j, and False otherwise.

<P>
<B>Problem 2:</B>
Make a program <code>AL_is_adjacent(G,u,v)</code> that, given a graph G
as an adjacency list, returns True if there is an edge from vertex i to
vertex j.  Note to test if an object x is an element of a set S, you can
use the code <code>x in S</code>.  For the analysis, assume that the command
<code>x in S</code> takes at most |S| steps to carry out.  (I believe the
Python implementation is much more efficient than this, but this is the
naive bound.)

<P>
<B>Problem 3:</B>
Make a program <code>EmptyGraph(n)</code> that makes the adjacency matrix
of a graph on n vertices with no edges.

<P>
<B>Problem 4:</B>
Make a program <code>CompleteGraph(n)</code> that makes the adjacency matrix
of a (simple) graph with an edge between all possible pairs of vertices i and
j. 

<p>
Warning: you might think to make a vector 
<code>onesv = [1, 1, ..., 1]</code> of all 1s, set 
<code>A = [onesv, onesv, ..., onesv]</code> and then just go through and
set each <code>A[i][i] = 0</code>.  The problem is, in the matrix A, each
row is the same list, so the command <code>A[0][0] = 0</code> will set the
whole first column equal to zero.  (You can try this for, e.g., a 3x3 matrix
to see what I'm talking about.)

<P>
<B>Problem 5:</B>
Make a program <code>CycleGraph(n)</code>
that generates a "cycle graph" on {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}, i.e., an
undirected graph with edges from i to i+1 for each i = 0, 1,2, ..., n-2,
and an edge from n-1 to 0.  (See p. 21 in the Chapter 1 notes for how to do
this as an adjacency list.)


<P>
<B>Problem 6:</b> If you finish all of these, you can get started on Exercises
1.3.7 and 1.3.8 that are part of the homework due next week.
