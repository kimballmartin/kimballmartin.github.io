<H3>Tasks</H3>

I'd like you to work on the following tasks in pairs. 

<p>
<b>Task 1:</b> (Exercise 2.1.7, part of Homework 7) 
Design an algorithm to predict which nodes went with vertex 0 and which went with vertex 33 in the karate club split. Explain your algorithm, code it up in 
Sage, and compare your results to the data from the actual split.

<p>
<B>Task 2:</b> (Exercise 2.1.6, not in Homework 7)
In case you finish Task 1, here is a second problem.  Design an
algorithm to count the number of cliques of order m in a graph G.  You
may use the <code>cliques_maximal()</code> function in Sage.
Code up your algorithm and test it on the Florentine families and karate
club graph.
