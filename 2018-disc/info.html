<P>
<B>goals:</B> while the course topics are centered around discrete structures 
in math (see <a href="http://www.math.ou.edu/undergrad/Course_CATALOGINFO.html">official catalogue description</a>), the primary goal for this course 
is to provide a bridge into abstract mathematics and learn how to read and write
proofs.  while there are some rules one should follow, mathematical thinking
is an art and proving is a social skill (admittedly, 
nerdier than most social skills), rather than a precise procedure to be
followed.  as such, these skills are best learned through back-and-forth
interactions, and this course is designed to facilitate these interactions.

<P><B>class participation:</B> while there may be some lecturing, the
bulk of the in-class time will be used for group work and discussions based
on the readings and assignments.  (see goals above.)  as such, it is 
crucial you keep up with the readings/assignments and participate in class.
participation will also be a direct component of your final grade.  
to increase the usefulness of discussions, keep track of questions you have
from the readings.

<p><B>reading exercises:</B> to help make sure you stay on track 
with the out-of-class readings and track your understanding of the material, 
there will be reading exercises associated with most readings.  
these will typically be a few simple exercises
from sections the reading, to be done
out of class when you do the reading and turned in in class on the due date
of the reading assignment.  i also encourage you to write down a list
of questions you have when you do the reading, which you can then ask
in class.
the exercies will be graded primarily on completion/effort (unlike the
problem sets and exams), and will count towards the
participation grade.  in class we will work on deepening your understanding
of the reading and you will have an opportunity to discuss your questions.

<p>
readings exercises will be posted on 
the main course page, typically at least 2 days before the due date.  
while you may discuss exercises with other students, you must write up
solutions in your own words.  late exercises are not accepted.


<P><B>problem sets:</b> there will be regular written problem sets (homework)
to be graded on correctness, as opposed to the reading
exercises.  these assignments will usually be posted about a week in advance on 
homework page on the course website, and due by the start of the class 
period on the due date.  
while you may discuss the problems with other students, you must write up
solutions in your own words.  
you may turn in up two 2 problem sets late (at the
start of the next class period) without penalty.  in exceptional 
circumstances, i may grant additional extensions--if you need one talk to me.

<p>
<B>exams:</B> there will be 2 in-class exams (<b>tba</b> and
<b>tba</b>) as well as the final exam (<b>tba</b>).
more info about the exams will be posted on the course website later in the
semester.
make-up exams are only given in exceptional circumstances
at the instructor's discretion.


<P> <B>grades:</B> 
at the end of the semester, i'm required to give you some grades.  these
will represent an approximation of my assessment of your understanding
of the material in the course.  the grades are weighted as follows:

<p>
25% class participation (mostly graded on reading exercises/in-class
work/attendance) <BR>
25% problem sets<BR>
25% in-class exams (weighted equally)<BR>
25% final exam<BR>

<p>
to be more precise, i will assign a letter grade to each of the 4 categories
(which may be "curved"),
and your final letter grade will come from averaging these 4 letter grades,
with borderline cases being decided on an individual basis (e.g., if your 4
letter grades are AABB or ABBB then the average is bewteen
an A and a B, so I will consider other factors such as effort and your overall
understanding at the end of the course to assign an A or a B.  if the
grades are AAAB i will round up to A).  in exceptional
cases (e.g., a poor start but a strong finish), i may adjust a final letter
grade to be higher than what the above procedure dictates.

<p>
to get a sense of how you are doing in the class, i will give you projected
letter grades around the time of the in-class exams.  if you have questions
about your performance or grade during the semester, please feel free to see
me.


<p>
<b>final remark:</b> if you have a question about course policies or 
expectations, just ask.
