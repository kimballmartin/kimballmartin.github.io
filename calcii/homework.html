<P>
<B>Disclaimer:</B> The list of topics and due date for each assignment is 
tentative and will be updated as the semester progresses.
<P>
<B>Homework guidelines:</B>  Each assignment is to be stapled in the upper left.
At the top of the first page, write the assignment number (e.g., "Homework 3").
In the upper right hand corner of the first page, please write your name,
course and discussion section number (e.g. MATH 2423 - 011 if you're in
discussion section 11).  Occasionally homeworks may get lost, and 
this helps them find their way home.

<p>Unless stated otherwise, each homework is due at the <i>beginning</i>
of lecture on the date listed (usually a Friday).

<P>
Solutions should appear in the order the
questions are listed on the homework, with any bonus questions at the end.  
If for
some reason you put them out of order, please make appropriate notes to redirect
the grader.  The assignment is to be written legibly and in complete sentences.
You will be graded not only on your final answer, but also on your explanation
and justification of it.  Your arguments should be clear and logically correct.
Justify each step.  Cite theorems and results when it is not obvious what you
are using.
You may use my solutions to examples in class as a guide.
The general principle is: you want to convince the grader you completely
understand how to solve it; present your solution as if you were teaching a
classmate who didn't know how to solve the problem. 

<P>
<b>Policies</b>:
Turning in an assignment means that, to the best of your knowledge and ability, you honestly abided by the following.  Unless stated otherwise,
you may not use calculators, computers, etc (including the web), 
other texts or solutions manuals to find the answers; however you are allowed 
to use these resources to check your answers before submission. Collaboration 
is allowed, and even encouraged, though you should earnestly try to solve each 
problem on your own before learning from someone else. 
However, you must write up (not copy) your solutions by yourself, in your own 
words.  If in doubt on the policies, please ask.
<i>Late homework is not accepted</i>, except in extenuating circumstances
at the discretion of the instructor.
