will be added as the exam dates near.

<H3>exam 1: wed feb 22 (in class)</H3>

this exam will cover everything we did, in lecture and homework,
on chapter 14.  while not necessarily a comprehensive list of things you may 
be expected to do on the exam, here are the main points you should be 
comfortable with (though there may not be time to ask about all of them on
the exam):

<ul>
<li> find/sketch <b>domain, range, graphs</b> for simple functions of 2 
variables.  you may also be asked about <i>level curves</i>.

<li> determine <b>partial derivatives, gradients</b> 
of functions of 2 or
3 variables, and use this to write down equations for the <b>tangent plane</b>
of a graph z=f(x,y) at a point.  you may need to use a tangent plane to do
<i>linear approximation</i> to approximate the value of a 2-variable function 
at a point.

<li> compute <b>directional derivatives</b> of functions of 2 or 3 variables,
be able to determine the direction of fastest increase or decrease
of a function of 2 or 3 variables (e.g., convert the gradient to convert to a 
unit vector)

<li> find <b>local/absolute minima/maxima</b>, 
as well as <b>saddle points</b>, of functions of 2 variables.  (think:
critical points and second derivatives test)  expect to have to deal with
regions with boundary points, where you may need to:

<li> use <b>lagrange multipliers</b> to maximize/minimize a function of 2 or 3 
variables subject to a constraint.  unless explicitly stated that you need
to use lagrange multipliers, you are also allowed to solve such problems by
the "substitution/reduction" method (e.g., as in example 5 in sec 14.7, 
though it may not be possible/easy to do so).
</ul>

<H3>exam 2: fri apr 7 (in class)</H3>

for exam 2, you will be allowed 1 handwritten (2-sided) <b>notecard</b>
(3x5", 4x6", or 1/4 of a sheet of US letter paper) to be prepared by you
in advance of the exam, with your name on the notecard.  you will be expected
to show me the notecard at the beginning of the exam period and turn it in at
the end of the exam period.  if you have questions about the notecard,
ask me <i>before</i> the exam.

<p>
this exam will cover everything we did, in lecture and homework,
on chapter 15.  
while not necessarily a comprehensive list of things you may 
be expected to do on the exam, here are the main points you should be 
comfortable with (though there may not be time to ask about all of them on
the exam):

<ul>
<li> compute <b>double</b> and <b>triple integrals</b> 
in cartesian (rectangular coordinates.  this includes setting up, and
possibly changing the order of, iterated integrals.

<li> compute <b>areas</b> of regions in the plane, and <b>surface areas</b> and 
<b>volumes</b> of regions in 3-space.

<li> be able to go back and forth between cartesian coordinates
and <b>polar coordinates</b> or <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>spherical
coordinates</b>, including translating integrals between these
different coordinate systems.

<li> compute double integrals using general <b>change of variables</b>
</ul>

here are some suggested <b>review problems</b> from the chapter 15 review
in the book (pp. 1101-1104).  i recommend you attempt these before clas
on wed apr 5, and i can try to answer any questions you have about them
wed in class or during office hours.  (standard disclaimer: these exercises
do not necessarily cover everything you will be tested on.)

<ul>
<li>concept check: 1(abc), 2(a), 3, 6, 9, 10(ab)
<li>true-false: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
<li>exercises: 3, 5, 9, 10, 13, 15, 25, 37, 38, 55
</ul>

<H3>final exam: fri may 12 (8-10am)</H3>

for the final exam, you will be allowed 1 handwritten notecard, with the
same rules as for exam 2.

<p>
this exam will be cumulative, covering chapters 14, 15 and 16 of stewart.
you should expect one page of true/false questions as well as 2-4 problems
on each of the 3 chapters covered.  (each of the 3 chapters will account
for roughtly 1/3 of the exam.)
a list of the main (but not necessarily
all) topics covered on the final exam is:

<ul>
<li>all the topics listed in the bullet points above for exams 1 and 2

<li><b>vector fields</b>: be able to draw them, determine if they are
<b>conservative</b>, and compute <b>curl</b> and <b>div</b>, and know
basic facts about div and curl.

<li><b>line integrals</b>: be able to compute the various kinds
of line integrals (ds, dx, dy, dz and vector field line integrals),
both directly as well as using the <b>fundamental theorem</b>,
<b>green's theorem</b> and <b>stokes' theorem</b>

<li><b>surface area</b>: be able to compute surface area in the plane
with double integrals as in ch 15 as well as with green's theorem, and
areas of more general surfaces such as graphs of functions or parametric
surfaces as in sec 16.6

<li><b>surface integrals</b>: be able to compute surface integrals of
scalar and vector fields (<b>flux</b>), both by rewriting as double integrals
as well as with the <b>divergence theorem</b>
</ul>

since there was no homework on the last 3 chapters, here are a few
practice problems for you on this material:

<ul>
sec 16.7: 5, 21, 25, 27<br>
sec 16.8: 3, 7<br>
sec 16.9: 5, 7
</ul>

in addition, here are some suggested problems from the ch 16 review
(pp 1188-1190):

<ul>
<li>concept check: 2a, 3abde, 4ab, 5-10, 11bc, 12abc, 13cd, 14-16
<li>true-false: 1-13
<li>exercises: 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 17, 18, 25, 27, 29, 30, 33, 34
</ul>
