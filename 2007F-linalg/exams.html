<H3>Final Examination (Sec.1 : Dec. 11 at 10:30, Sec. 4: Dec. 13 at 8am) </H3>

The final exam is cumulative, though it will focus more on the latter part
of the course.  I suggest you review, at the minimum, Homeworks 11-15, Exam 2
and go over

<p>
<a href = "hw16.pdf">Homework 16</a>
</p>

before the exam.  Please try to do Homework 16 before the last day of class,
and bring your questions as before.  I highly recommend you treat Homework 16
as a <i> practice exam</i> (study, then try it on your own without any help).
(Of course, the real exam will include more questions similar to those on 
Exam 2 also.)
Then you may check your answers with mine:

Good luck!
