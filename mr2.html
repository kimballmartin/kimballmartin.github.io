Rankin on Mac Fhraing. 
Any paper in Gaelic is alright in my book.
Note, the reviewer (R.A. Rankin) = the author (Rob Alasdair Mac Fhraing).<P>

I'm sad that there's no review of this item.<P>

Another example where the reviewer is an author.

The author, Dwork, apparently wrote under the pseudonym of Maurizio 
Boyarsky so he
wouldn't have to refer to Dwork cohomology in one of his own papers.  Then
he later wrote 
<A HREF="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=MR0692108">this paper</A>
(under his own name) which he names after his pseudonym!
<P>

The famous Cox-Zucker paper.

<H3>2006 Contest Results</H3>

On June 24, 2006: I posted the following challenge:
<P>
I will award small prizes (maybe in Spring 2007 when I think of something good) for each of the following three/six
categories:<P>
1. Finding the paper on MathSciNet with the most references. 
<BR>Best so far:  Book ?;  Paper 232 (Yau, Review of Geometry and Analysis) <BR>
2. Finding the paper on MathSciNet with the most reference citations
<BR>Best so far:  Book 1731 (Gilbarg & Trudinger);  Paper 430 (Gromov, Hyperbolic Groups)
<BR>
3. Finding the review on MathSciNet with the most review citations
<BR>Best so far:  Book 74 (Connes); Paper 87 (Wiles, Modular elliptic curves...)<P>

I never really officially the contest, though due to lack of contributions 
it seems to be effectively ended, with the results being listed above (the
papers/books/reviews being likely close to correct, and the number
references dating from sometime near the end of 2006).
In any case, this contest seems to have been made mostly obsolete by some of 
the newer MathSciNet tools.
I also never made good on my claims of awarding prizes, as 1) no good
prizes came to mind so far, and 2) no one seems to care.  Sorry.  You can
give me a D on Angie's List.
