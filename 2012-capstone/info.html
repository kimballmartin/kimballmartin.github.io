<P>
Please read this page carefully. You will be responsible
for all the information given here, and for any modifications to it that
may be announced in class.  Any such modifications will be made on the course
webpage.

<P>
<B>Text:</B> There is no assigned text for the class, though some suggested
references and handouts may be given throughout the semester.

<P>
<B>Content:</B> We will cover various topics throughout the semester, based at
least partially on class interest.  Some possible topics are: graph theory
and networks, game theory, Brownian motion and pattern recognition.

While this is a mathematics course, not a programming course, there will be 
some amount of computing/programming required in this course.  You will be
expected to use Python 2, though other languages/software may be allowed at the
discretion of the instructor.

<P>

<B>Instructor:</B> Kimball Martin

<P><B>Contact note:</B>
 Even though I may send periodic emails from my
university ou email address (as opposed to the math.ou.edu one above), I do not
check it nearly as frequently.  Thus you are advised to use the address above
when contacting me if you want a timely response.

<P><B>Class Participation</B> 
will be an integral part of this course.  (While there will be lecturing,
this is not a standard lecture course.)  As such, attendance is mandatory.
Occasional  absences (for legitimate reasons)
are permitted at the discretion of the instructor.   


<P>
<B>Assignments:</B> 
There will be written and computer assignments to turn in, 
as well as assignments requiring class
participation and presentations.  These will be announced in class and posted
on the course webpage.  
A rough guideline is that you should plan to spend
and average of 6 hours each week on work out of class.

<p>
<B>Quizzes:</B> 
To make sure you are keeping up with the material, there will be periodic
quizzes during class.  These will be announced in class at least 1 lecture
prior to the quiz.
You may not use notes, texts, calculators, computers or other references 
during the quizzes.  Make-up quizzes 
are not given except in extenuating circumstances.

<p>
<B>Final Exam:</B> 
The final exam period for this course is Moon Day, December 10 from 8-10am.
While there will be no written final exam, this period will be used
for in-class presentations and attendance is manditory.  An unexcused absence
will result in a lower letter grade, with the exception of students who are
already failing.

<P> <B>Grades:</B> 
Your final letter grades will be determine from a final numeric grade
consisting of
<BR>
40% Assignments<BR>
40% Class Participation<BR>
20% Quizzes<BR>

<P>
<B>Withdrawal Policy:</B> 
Please consult the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/content/admissions/home/academic_calendar/fall_2012.html">academic calendar</a> for consequences of withdrawal
during different times of the semester.

<P>
<B>Grade of Incomplete:</B> The grade of &ldquo;I&#8221; is a special-purpose
grade given when a specific task needs to be completed to finish the
coursework. This is typically a term paper or other special
assignment, so rarely makes sense in a mathematics course. An &ldquo;I&#8221;
cannot be given to avoid receiving a low grade.

<P>
<B>Academic Misconduct:</B> If cases of academic misconduct arise, they
will be dealt with according to (rather strict) University policies.  Remember
that you responsible for knowing and adhering to the University guidelines
for academic integrity:
<p>
<i><a href="http://www.ou.edu/provost/integrity/">http://www.ou.edu/provost/integrity/</a></i>
<p>
as well as the student code:

</i>

<P>
<B>Students with Disabilities:</B> If you have a disability that may
interfere with the demonstration of your abilities, please contact me as
soon as possible to arrange accomodations necessary to ensure your full
participation in the course.  You should also contact the Office of Disability
Services, Goddard Health Center, Suite 166 (325-3852 or TDD 325 4173).
